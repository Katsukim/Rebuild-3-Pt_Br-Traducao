wedding_pictureColin2 = true
wedding_1 = Well here's something the Zombies can't stop. [Name] and [Name2] have fallen in love and want to get hitched! A wedding would be just what we need. Seeing these two in love will remind us all what we're fighting for.
wedding_option1 = Hold a small wedding under a tree
wedding_option2 = Have a crazy party! (10 food)
wedding_option3 = Don't let them get married
wedding_outcome1 = Seeing [Name] and [Name2] kiss and say their vows uplifted all of us. I hope we see more of this.
wedding_outcome2_picture = party
wedding_outcome2 = Love is something to celebrate! We had a big party and danced the night away!
wedding_outcome3_straight_1 = [Name] wouldn't let it go. "What, is it because you think we'll want to have kids next and you don't want to deal with that? Well listen, kids are the _point_ of all this, okay? Love, and families, and children: that's the point of living. What the hell else are we rebuilding for?"\n\n
"Just because [Name2] and I are ready to take that step and you aren't doesn't give you the right to stop us. You can't stop us from loving each other!"
wedding_outcome3_straight_2 = [Name] and [Name2] were crestfallen, but they didn't seem very surprised. I explained that this isn't the time or place for people to be getting married. They barely know each other, and hell, one or the other might be dead tomorrow. We need to focus on the tasks at hand.\n\n
Some of the others are upset, but they agreed to let the matter drop for now.
This isn't the time or the place for marriage. Everyone is pissed now but we have to focus on the task at hand.
wedding_outcome3_gay_1 = [Name] was furious. "What, is it because we're gay? Are you worried other people might catch it if they see us happy together?" [He] spat at me. "I thought we left all this crap behind after the infection. I thought we were moving _forward_."\n\n
[He] shook [his] head. "Well you might not recognize our union but you can't stop us from loving one another. Life's too short."
wedding_outcome3_gay_2 = [Name] and [Name2] were crestfallen, but they didn't seem very surprised. I explained that this isn't the time or place for people to be getting married.

enemiesWillFightWarning_picture = gate
enemiesWillFightWarning_1 = Well I guess we can't all be one big lovey-dovey ball of joy. [Name] and [Name2] haven't liked each other since they met. This morning they almost got into a fist fight over some nonsense. We'd better keep these two apart or things are gonna get ugly.

# Enemies Fight Event
enemiesFight_title = Enemies Fight
enemiesFight_picture = gate
enemiesFight_1 = Well [Name] and [Name2] could never get along and today it spilled over into violence. [Name2] is going to need some time to recover from [his2] injuries. We should keep these two apart.

# Name2 convinced Name to become devout, need a church
madeDevoutFriend_title = [Name] became devout

madeDevoutFriend_pictureColin = true
madeDevoutFriend_pictureColin2 = true

madeCultistPreacher_title = [Name] became a cultist
madeCultistPreacher_picture = church
madeCultistPreacher_pictureColin = true
madeCultistPreacher_pictureColin2 = false
madeCultistPreacher_1 = [Name] started coming to church regularly, to hear about the Chosen Ones and have [his] aura metered. Now that [Name2's] preaching there, it's really drawing a crowd.

madeCultistFriend_title = [Name] became a cultist
madeCultistFriend_picture = church
madeCultistFriend_pictureColin = true
madeCultistFriend_pictureColin2 = true
madeCultistFriend_1 = [Name] has started worshiping the dead. [He] and [Name2] have gotten close and [Name2] convinced [him] the Church of the Chosen Ones know the only path to truth and happiness.

# mentionedColin became cultist meeting the chosen
madeCultistChosen_title = [Name] became a cultist
madeCultistChosen_picture = church
madeCultistChosen_pictureColin = true
madeCultistChosen_1 = [Name] has started telling people [he] believes in the teachings of the Church of the Chosen Ones. [He] says when [he] saw and heard them in person it just all made sense, that it explained things [he]'d thought and felt since the outbreak.

growUp_title = They grow up so young
growUp_picture = walls
growUp_pictureColin = true
growUp = [Name] is now 14 years old... in the old days [he] still couldn't drive, drink, or vote, but life's different now. It goes faster. In [his] 14 years, [Name] has probably learned more life lessons than your average middle-aged [man] would have back then.\n\n
So we're proud today to call [him] a [man]. [Name] now has full independence, [his] own home, and the same responsibilities as everyone else here. Good job, kid.

reequippedGoat_title = Child assigned to caretaker
reequippedGoat_picture = shed
reequippedGoat_pictureColin = true
reequippedGoat = These kids need someone to keep an eye on them at all times or who knows what might happen. We assigned [Name] to take care of {1}.

# {Name2] spouse, if exists
# {1} is the baby's name
makeBabby_title = A Baby was Formed
makeBabby_picture = hospital
makeBabby_pictureColin = true
makeBabby_pictureColin2 = true
makeBabby_1 = Bundle of joy, or mouth to feed? It all depends on perspective. Personally, I'm not sure why we'd be doing this if it weren't for the next generation. May their lives be better than ours, at least in the long run.\n\n
And with that sentimental note, congratulations to [Name] on the birth of [his] baby {1}!
# replace when spouse exists
makeBabbyCouple_1 =  [Name] and [Name2] have big news... they made a baby! Welcome to the world, {1}!
makeBabbyCouple_2 = Bundle of joy, or mouth to feed? It all depends on perspective. Personally, I'm not sure why we'd be doing this if it weren't for the next generation. May their lives be better than ours, at least in the long run.\n\n
And with that sentimental note, congratulations to [Name] and [Name2] on the birth of their baby {1}!
# replace when policy says no babbies
makeBabbyDisallowed = Once again, mother nature completely ignored the laws of man, and allowed a baby to be born despite our policy against it. What can you do...\n\n
Hopefully [Name] will take responsibility for this tiny burden.
makeBabbyLeader = I'm a [father]! This is amazing!\n\n
Amazingly terrifying. How will I keep little {1} safe from all the terrors of this world?\n\n
On the bright side, at least I don't have to worry about saving up for a college education.

#Kid gets in trouble if they are send on a dangerous mission. Two variations: one they stay in the fort alone, another where they went on the mission. Their caretaker can rescue them, but there is a chance of injury based on their defense, roll on ten.
# basically an excuse to let a child die you monstrous players you
# [Name] has goat equipped, [Name2] = goat, [missioning] = name's mission
goatTrouble_title = Goonies never say die
goatTrouble_picture = creepyWoods
goatTrouble_pictureColin1 = false
goatTrouble_pictureColin2 = true
goatTrouble_1 = Who would bring a child on such a dangerous mission? [FormalName], that's who. [He] took [Name2] [missioning] with [him], and predictably the kid wandered off and got cornered by something.\n\n
In this case it's just a wild dog, but seriously the largest, meanest looking beast we've ever encountered. I'd bet money it's rabid, maybe even infected if that's a thing that can happen.\n\n
[Name2] climbed up a tree to escape it, but [he2]'s clinging to a branch up there. What do we do?
goatTrouble_2 = [FormalName] went off [missioning] and left young [Name2] at home by [himself2]. Seems reasonable, I mean, better that than bring the kid on a dangerous mission, but without someone to watch out for [him2], [Name2] has ended up in trouble.\n\n
[He2] must have been teasing the zombies from the top of the wall, throwing rocks at them or something, when [he2] fell. Now a zombie has [him2] pinned under one of the rusting car chassis that form the wall. Someone has to save [him2]!
goatTrouble_3 = One of our children, [FormalName2] is in peril! [He2] was with the group [missioning] at a [square] when a slow-moving herd of zed came shuffling through. All [he2] had to do was stay quiet and out of sight and they would've walked right by, but the poor [boy2] panicked and screamed.\n\n
Now [he2]'s stuck in a parked car, and the zed could get through the windshield at any moment.
goatTrouble_option1 = Send [Name] to save [him2]
goatTrouble_option2 = Hope [he2]'ll be okay
# do a defense roll on level 10
goatTrouble_outcome1_success = [Name] jumped into action, fighting off the enemy singlehandedly with remarkable heroism. I'd continue to praise [his] abilities, but honestly [he]'s the one that got [Name2] into this mess in the first place.\n\n
A note to future parents: dangerous mission and children don't mix.
# [Name] is injured
goatTrouble_outcome1_fail = Thank the gods [Name2] is safe, but [Name] didn't do so well. [He] hoisted the [boy2] up on [his] shoulders to protect [him2] while they escaped, then tripped and toppled both of them over. [Name2] was thrown clear with a few bruises, but [Name] face planted into a rock and gave [himself] a concussion.\n\n
The swelling's starting to go down but that black eye's turning all kinds of colors.
goatTrouble_outcome2 = I... I don't know how to write this but... [Name2] didn't make it. We are one survivor less today. One of our youngest. This is no world for children. Just... no.

#Starvation. Do you feed the child our feed the adult. The other one dies. If you are evil cannibal you can eat the child optionally.
# triggers instead of starvation death event sometimes
# [Name] has goat equipped, [Name2] = goat
goatStarve_title = Starvation
goatStarve_picture = noFood
goatStarve_pictureColin1 = false
goatStarve_pictureColin2 = true
goatStarve_1 = This is the kind of decision a parent should never ever have to make: whether to feed their child so that [he2] lives, or feed yourself so you can get out there and find more food for both of you.\n\n
It has finally come to this in [CityName].
goatStarve_2 = We've been out of real food for weeks, anything with protein or fat in it at all. Down to just empty carbs, the very thing dieters used to hate. Malnutrition illness become commonplace here: anemia, scurvy, rickets. Especially susceptible are the children.\n\n
Parents will always want to feed their children before themselves, but what good is a child whose parent has died of starvation? What will they eat if there is no one to provide for them?
goatStarve_3 = Children are much more affected by malnutrition than adults. One drought, one crop failure, one badly-timed raid could mean a child forever twisted by diseases of the bones and nervous system.\n\n
On the other hand, if the parent isn't fed first, they might not be around to protect that child in the future, and they'll both die in the end.\n\n
Sadly, it has come time for such decisions in [CityName]. Who do we feed first?
goatStarve_option1 = Feed [FormalName] first
goatStarve_option2 = Feed [his] child [Name2] first
goatStarve_outcome1_picture = grave
goatStarve_outcome1 = Both adult and child had been sick for a long while, but it is with a heavy heart that I must record that [FormalName2] has died. I'm so sorry for your loss [Name]. I can't... I can't imagine...
goatStarve_outcome2_picture = grave
goatStarve_outcome2 = [FormalName] has died. [He] took [his] own life, rather than take food from [his] child's mouth.\n\n
I wish I could have been there, to make [him] look into [Name2's] eyes and see that the [boy2] needed a [father] now more than ever. I wish I could have convinced [him] it's going to get better any day now, there will be more food.\n\n
I wish I believed that myself...
# replaces goatStarve_outcome1 if you have EventType.FOOD_EVIL_CANNIBALS
goatStarveCannibal_picture = corpse
goatStarveCannibal_title = A Modest Proposal
goatStarveCannibal = I... this is hard to write. [FormalName's] child [Name2] has died.\n\n
We're all dying, but the death of a child hits the hardest. It is the death of the future. The death of hope.\n\n
We've been in these dark places before, spent eternity here it seems, but despite the constant toll on our hearts and our will to go on, we continue to do whatever it takes to survive.
So once again, the decision: do we bury the body, or consume it to stay alive?
goatStarveCannibal_option1 = Bury the body
# grants regular cannibalism food /2 and happiness -5 to whole fort (and/or take parents + guardian to zero)
goatStarveCannibal_option2 = Eat the body
goatStarveCannibal_outcome1 = Child, parent, stranger, friend. What does it matter once we've shuffled off this mortal coil and left our corpses upon the earth? We're all the same, then. Just meat.
goatStarveCannibal_outcome2 = Eating children are where we draw the line. I didn't know there was a line to cannibalism until I reached it, but there it is, and I'm not crossing it: we don't eat kids. We'll die first.\n\n
Prophetic words, no doubt.

#Well bucket is stuck or air duct leads to cool inventions room in lab. Only child will fit. Do you send them? Half the time they get stuck and you don't hear them. Can send a second child. Half the time they both come back. Our a hilarious loop.
# [Name] = first goat
# [Name2] = second goat, {1} = name of found equipment in case of success
# [square] random building in the fort that might have goodies in the basement (bank, lab, police dept, skyscraper, others?)

#[well | lost&found | garbage]
goatHole_title = The Hole
goatHole_picture = shed
goatHole_pictureColin1 = true
goatHole_pictureColin2 = false
goatHole_1 = [We've been relying on an old well for some of our drinking water. It really is old, like circa 1910, but the water is surprisingly pure. Much easier than collecting rainwater. The problem is, the bucket keeps getting stuck on something down there, and today it jammed up completely and won't come up or down.\n\n
None of us can fit down there, but young [FormalName] has narrow enough shoulders that [he] could fit. Should we send [him] down to fix it?|We've got this schematic says there's a lost & found in our [square], but the door's three feet of solid steel and bolted shut. Who needs that kind of protection for a lost & found? Gotta be something cool in there.\n\n
There are air ducts going to the room... we wouldn't fit, but we could send a kid through there, like [FormalName]. [He]'d fit.|Someone accidentally threw their wedding ring down the garbage chute but it got stuck halfway. And there's something else glinting down there...\n\n
Should we send little [FormalName] to crawl in there and get it?]
goatHole_option1 = Send [Name] to crawl in
goatHole_option2 = Forget it
goatHole_outcome1_success = That little [Name] could have been an excellent chimney sweep in 15th century England. [He] just scurried on in there and did the job.\n\n
[Turns out the well was blocked by {1}.|The lost & found turned out to be legit, no idea why it was so fortified. Nothing in there but mittens and sunglasses. [He] did find {1} at least.|Ring retrieved! [He] also found {1} which was blocking the chute.]
goatHole_outcome1_fail_pictureColin1 = false
goatHole_outcome1_fail_pictureColin2 = true
goatHole_outcome1_fail = At first [Name] was chatty with nervousness, then became quieter as [he] got more afraid. Then there was a thump, and silence. We've been yelling to [him] for the past two hours, but no reply.\n\n
None of us can fit in there... except another child. [FormalName2] volunteered to go down and help [his2] friend.
goatHole_outcome1_fail_option1 = Send [Name2] in too
goatHole_outcome1_fail_option2 = Forget it
goatHole_outcome1_fail_outcome1_success_pictureColin1 = true
goatHole_outcome1_fail_outcome1_success_pictureColin2 = true
goatHole_outcome1_fail_outcome1_success = [Name2] rubbed the snot from [his2] nose and valiantly climbed in there after [Name]. Twenty minutes later both of them were safe and sound. Turns out [Name] had just panicked after a short fall, but [he] was fine.\n\n
They also pulled out {1} with them.
goatHole_outcome1_fail_outcome1_fail = We sent [Name2] in with a rope around [his2] waist this time, and when [he2] got to where [Name] was, [he2] tugged the line to let us know to help them up.\n\n
Tragically... I don't know how to say this but, [Name] had died. [He] must have slipped and broken [his] neck somehow in there. We didn't think it would be dangerous, really. Compared to the zombies outside... we forget that life is so fragile.
goatHole_outcome1_fail_outcome2 = We held a vigil at the [well|air duct|garbage chute], and practically pulled the place apart to get in there and rescue [him]... but by the time we did it was too late. [Name] was dead.
goatHole_outcome2 = No, I won't put the lives of any of our survivors at risk for this. [We can find other sources of water.|We don't need to know what's on the other side of that door.|We can live without mere symbols like that ring.]

# replace if parent is on MissionTech
goatHelpTech_picture = lab
goatHelpTech = I didn't think having a child help out with research would be a good idea, but [Name2] is surprisingly good at it. [He2]'s a natural little engineer. Maybe [he2]'ll even be a scientist one day if the world ever has need of them again. Research is going a little faster this week because of it.
# replace if parent is on MissionFarm
goatHelpFarm_picture = farm
goatHelpFarm = Young [Name2] has been helping [FormalName] to farm. Mostly just pick rocks out of the ground, but that's hard work that needs to be done too.
# replace if parent is on MissionBuild, MissionReclaim or MissionUpgrade
goatHelpBuild_picture = walls
goatHelpBuild = [FormalName's] combining [missioning] with babysitting; namely [he]'s got [Name2] fetching supplies and cleaning up. The kid couldn't pound a nail straight if [his2] life depended on it, but if [he2] keeps practicing [he2]'ll get it. Job's going a bit faster anyway.
# replace if parent is on MissionScavenge
goatHelpScavenge_picture = pawnshop
goatHelpScavenge = I wasn't sure that bringing a kid scavenging was a good idea, but [FormalName] insisted that [his] kid [Name2] would be perfect for it. It's true; the [boy2]'s got a keen eye for what's useful, and can fit into places the rest of us couldn't go.\n\n
[He2] found some extra {1} today, that's useful.
# replace if parent is on MissionPostLead
goatHelpLead_picture = bar
goatHelpLead = [FormalName] has been bringing [his] [boy2] [Name2] to the [square] this week so [he2] can help out. The kid's a natural, and people love [him2].

goatNightmares = [FormalName] hasn't been able to sleep much lately since [his] [boy2] [Name2] has been keeping [him] awake every night. The kid's having nightmares. We all do of course, but these are like white-knuckled, piss-the-bed, wake-up-screaming night terrors. [He2]'s obviously stressed and traumatized.\n\n
What should we do about it?

# no effect
goatNightmares_outcome2 = [Name2] had a casual counselling session where [he2] described [his2] bad dreams and worst fears; stuff the poor [boy2] didn't want to burden [Name] with.\n\n
[He2] said [he2] felt a lot better afterwards and we discussed a few ways that [he2] could deal with the night terrors if they do happen. We can keep having regular talks like this for as long as it takes.
# no effect
goatNightmares_outcome3 = This [boy2] needs something to keep [him2] distracted. We've been so focused on survival, we forgot [he2]'s missing out on [his2] childhood here because of it. So we organized a kids-only activity center at the local schoolhouse, where [Name2] can play games, do crafts, and we might throw some [boy]scout skills in there too. Just mentioning it brought a sparkle to [his2] eyes.
# minus happiness to Name for not sleeping due to kids nightmares
goatNightmares_outcome4 = [Name] said [he] understands; we need [him] out there working, even if [he]'s a bit sleep deprived.

goatFind_option1 = Take the {1}
goatFind_option2 = Let [him2] keep it
goatFind_outcome1 = [Name2] cried like a baby when we told [him2] [he2] couldn't keep the {1}. Honestly, there's an entire civilization's worth of junk lying around here that [he2] could play with. Why was that one thing so important?\n\n
[FormalName] is a bit miffed that we upset [his] [boy2], but the kid needs to learn that [the needs of the many outweigh the selfish desires of little brats|sharing is caring].
goatFind_outcome2 = We don't need that {1} as much as [Name2] wants it right now. Hopefully [he2] won't have forgotten it by tomorrow or ditched it in favor of a new toy.

The kid is in shock; [he2] hasn't said a word. We don't know where [he2]'s from or what happened to [his2] family, but can guess the worst. [He2]'s been sticking close to [Name].

The [boy2] was instantly at home with them. We couldn't hold [him2] back when [he2] saw the massive collection of action figures they'd amassed. Rufus stopped goofing off for a minute to thank us.
# minus happinsess? or no downside?
goatAdopt_outcome3 = The [boy2]'s parents must be out there in the city, desperately searching for [him2]. They _must_ be. We gave the little tyke a fresh set of clothes and a tin of sweets, then dropped [him2] off way on the other side of the city, in a big square where we figured [his2] family would be most likely to spot [him2].\n\n
Oh God... what have we done...

Rufus too a deep breath. "THERE ARE NO OTHER RULES!!"\n\n
Good god it's amazing these kids have survived so long... good luck [Name]!
# no effect except you keep the kid
goatLeave_outcome2 = No. Those St Michaels kids are completely unhinged. It isn't safe over there. No child of ours is going to be roughhousing, staying up past their bedtime, or doing any of the other possibly crazy fun things those boys get up to.\n\n

goatAbortion = [FormalName] came to confide in me today, to tell me [he]'s discovered [he]'s pregnant. It was an accident, [he] says... one impulsive night when it seemed like they could die any day.\n\n
Now [he] can't imagine bringing a child into this world with so little chance of a happy life. [He]'s begging me to fix the problem.
# mention that we agree with her decision
goatAbortionPolicyNoBabbies = [FormalName] came to confide in me today, to tell me [he]'s discovered [he]'s pregnant. It was an accident, [he] says... one impulsive night when it seemed like they could die any day. [He] knows we have a policy to avoid pregnancy, but sometimes things just happen.\n\n
Now [he] can't imagine bringing a child into this world with so little chance of a happy life. [He]'s begging me to fix the problem.
# must have the baby if our policy says so (option1 will be disabled)
goatAbortionPolicyYesBabbies = [FormalName] came to confide in me today, to tell me [he]'s discovered [he]'s pregnant. It was an accident, [he] says... one impulsive night when it seemed like they could die any day.\n\n
Now [he] can't imagine bringing a child into this world with so little chance of a happy life. [He]'s begging me to fix the problem.\n\n
Abortion goes against our pro-family policy, so I'm afraid it is not an option.
goatAbortion_option1 = Perform an abortion (hospital)
goatAbortion_option2 = Perform abortion without hospital
goatAbortion_option3 = Have the baby
goatAbortion_outcome1 = [Name] is right; only a monster would intentionally bring a child into such a messed up world. But even if [he] was wrong, it's [his] body and [his] choice. We stand by that.
goatAbortion_outcome2 = I warned [Name] that we don't have the means to safely do such an operation. [He] insisted, saying [he]'d be more likely to die in childbirth... which I admit statistically quite true with or without a hospital. Then even threatened to kill [himself].\n\n
So we went ahead with it in the most sterile conditions we could manage. Since we don't have many antibiotics to spare, we insisted that [Name] stay home for a few days to full recover.
goatAbortion_outcome3 = [Name] made [his] bed, now [he] has to give birth in it. I'm not going to try to explain why a month-old embryo has a soul but sperm doesn't, or feed [him] made-up facts about the dangers of abortion vs carrying a child to term.\n\n
The truth is, the world needs more people in it. Children are necessary for our survive as a species. Someone has to have them.\n\n
Hopefully [Name] will change [his] mind about being a mother by the time the baby comes.

# Pregnant woman has anxiety.
# must be at least 6 months pregnant

preggersComplain_pictureColin2 = false
preggersComplain = [FormalName] is pregnant. It happens. But whether it's the hormones or the impending responsibility of raising a child in a post-apocalyptic world, she's really freaking out about it.\n\n
She's constantly worried that the baby is kicking too much, or not enough. She refuses to go anywhere near the outside wall, and admonishes people for so much as carrying a weapon near her. She's irritated by conditions in the fort, particularly by the diet which she says is putting her baby's health at risk. In short, she's driving us nuts. What should we do?
preggersComplain_option1 = Insist that she work
preggersComplain_option2 = Give her some time off
preggersComplain_option3 = Increase her rations
preggersComplain_outcome1 = I hoped that putting [Name] to work would help keep her mind off the baby, but so far she's just furious about it. I'm worried that her anxiety is starting to catch.
preggersComplain_outcome2 = [Name] needs to take a vacation and just chill the hell out. Anxiety is one of the worst things for an unborn child, besides perhaps malnutrition or her mother getting bit by a zombie. Hopefully taking time off doesn't cause either of those things to happen...
preggersComplain_outcome3 = Now that [Name] is eating better, her mind is much more at ease. Maybe her crankiness was just caused by hunger? I mean we all get that way sometimes. It must be much harder when you're eating for two though. Hopefully she'll start to fill out more now... she's so skinny I was a bit worried myself!

mainFirstDate_pictureColin2 = true
mainFirstDate_1 = I've noticed some of the other survivors here making come-hither eyes at me lately. I'm not sure it's totally appropriate, since I'm their leader. I call most of the shots around here and might be accused of playing favorites, but... the point of living is to live, right?\n\n
Should I ask someone on a date?
mainFirstDate_2 = I've been getting close with some of the survivors here in [CityName]. It's comforting to have friends again after such a long time spent wandering alone, but I wonder if some of them are looking for something more... or maybe they're just sucking up to me because I'm the leader here. Only one way to find out...\n\n
Should I ask someone on a date?
mainFirstDate_3 = I'm lonely. We're all lonely, but it's especially hard for me because I'm supposed to be the leading the rest of them. I can't show weakness. But maybe if I found a special someone, I could be honest with them.\n\n
Should I ask someone on a date?

mainFirstDate_option3 = Somebody else
mainFirstDate_option4 = Nobody
# leads back around to original 4 options but with 2 different people
# eventually goes through an entire list of BFFs then wraps around to restart
mainFirstDate_outcome3 = I don't really know everyone here well enough to ask them. It's not like the old days of internet dating... many of the people here are mourning the loss of their husbands and wives, and will be for many years. Dating is a delicate, touchy subject.\n\n
If there's someone in particular I'm interested in, I should get to know them as friends first.
mainFirstDate_outcome4 = I'm not sure when I'll be ready for love again, but it isn't now.
# option 1 and 2 both lead here

mainFirstDate_picked = [FormalName]. I've had my eye on [him] since [he] joined us. [He]'s friendly, [he]'s eager to help, and a pretty talented [job], but most importantly... [he] has nice eyes.\n\n
[He] said yes! Where should we go for our first date?

mainFirstDate_picked_outcome1 = I cooked us a wonderful dinner (spaghetti and canned meatballs - [he] said [he] loved it), and shared a bottle of wine I'd had hidden away for nearly a year waiting just such a special occasion.\n\n
Then we took a walk along the wall and up to a lookout spot where I surprised [him] with a little display I'd prepared: the [square] on the other side of our wall suddenly lit up in flames, immolating all the zombies in it. We basked in the glow and held each other tight.

mainFirstDate_picked_outcome2_success_pictureColin2 = false
mainFirstDate_picked_outcome2_success = I took [him] to a zoo I'd found at the edge of the city. Someone had let all the animals out of their cages, and they now roam the grounds letting survival of the fittest take its course. We were frolicking with the rabbits, clear winners in the outbreed-everyone-else category, when a tiger pounced out from the bushes.\n\n
I jumped up and gave it stiff kick to its sensitive nose. The big cat screeched and lept away in search of an easier meal. [Name] was impressed.
# on fail, injure main leader, +20 happiness for both "I wrestled a tiger on a first date!"
mainFirstDate_picked_outcome2_fail_picture = hospital

mainFirstDate_picked_outcome2_fail = I took [him] to a zoo I'd found at the edge of the city. Someone had let all the animals out of their cages, and they now roam the grounds letting survival of the fittest take its course. We were frolicking with the rabbits, clear winners in the outbreed-everyone-else category, when a tiger pounced out from the bushes.\n\n
It slashed me deeply across the abdomen and knocked me down. "This is how it ends? A _tiger_??" I thought. Then [Name] fired a shot and scared it away.\n\n
What an exciting (but painful!) first date!
# +10 materials
mainFirstDate_picked_outcome3_picture = store
mainFirstDate_picked_outcome3_pictureColin1 = true
mainFirstDate_picked_outcome3_pictureColin2 = false
mainFirstDate_picked_outcome3 = There's far too much work to do. We don't have time for a proper romantic date... but I wanted to spend time with [Name] all the same. We decided to clear out some of the old buildings here that our scavengers hadn't gotten to yet.\n\n
It was sweaty, exhausting work, hauling out anything that might be useful as building materials. But we hardly noticed. We were too busy joking and playing and flirting with each other. We didn't want the day to end.\n\n
Good news is, it doesn't have to. I can assign us to work together any time I like.


# main leader and gf/bf are talking, repeat even after engaged or married
# [Name] = whoever main leader is dating
# [Name2] = main leader, who is also the reporter
mainDating_title = The Dating Game
mainDating_picture = shed
mainDating_pictureColin1 = true
mainDating_pictureColin2 = false
mainDating_1 = [FormalName] and I cooked breakfast together this morning. [He] showed me how to make a coffee substitute from roasted dandelion roots. There's no caffeine in it, but I have to admit it does kind of taste like coffee.\n\n
We got to talking about our future together. It would be wonderful to have mornings like this all the time...
mainDating_2 = I got into an argument with [FormalName] yesterday. I said we couldn't spend the evening together because I was assigned to do nightly guard duty. [He] asked me why I couldn't just switch my slot with someone else's; I wrote the guard duty schedule after all. [He] accused me of avoiding [him] on purpose.\n\n
I don't know... maybe [he]'s right and I was avoiding [him]. Now I think [he]'s giving me the silent treatment.
mainDating_3 = I've had so many happy moments with [FormalName] since we started dating. Every minute I get to spend with [him] is a minute of carefree joy. I forget all my fears of an impending attack on the fort, all the pressure of leading such a diverse group of damaged, frightened people. When we're together it's just me, and [him].\n\n
Just thinking about this today for no particular reason. Maybe I should go see how [he]'s doing.
mainDating_option1 = Go on a date
# hidden if already engaged/married
mainDating_option2 = Propose marriage
mainDating_option3 = Break up
mainDating_outcome1 = What should we do on our date?
# increase relationship, to a max of DATING_END, +10 happy for each
mainDating_outcome1_option1 = Have dinner together
mainDating_outcome1_option2 = Go for a long walk together
mainDating_outcome1_option3 = Kill zombies together
mainDating_outcome1_outcome1 = We grabbed some food from the communal cantina ([salt cod stew|rice and beans|cornmeal gruel]... again) and ate it back at my place. It's wonderful to spend time with [Name]... it doesn't really matter what we do to be honest. Just hanging out and killing time suddenly has all this meaning when [he]'s around.
mainDating_outcome1_outcome2 = We walked laps around the edge of the fort for hours, laughing and talking.\n\n
I suppose it doubled as guard duty too, though we were so busy gazing into each other's eyes I'm not sure we would have noticed a breach if it happened right beside us. I think we're making some of the others jealous.
mainDating_outcome1_outcome3 = There's a section of wall that we've set up as a honeypot for zombies: it's reinforced with steel bars, but there are big gaps the zed can see us through. They cluster there, and it's the easiest thing to ram a long spike through their foreheads from a safe distance on the other side of the fence.\n\n
Some consider it a chore, but [Name] and I made a game of it, challenging to see if we could spike two at once or who could kill the most in a minute.
# if relationship is DATING_END, success, change to ENGAGED, +20 happy for both
mainDating_outcome2_success = [He] said yes!! We're getting married! Eventually!!\n\n
We just need to find the right time and place for a ceremony. Until then we can bask in the glow of being engaged. I'm sure the others will find the two of us even more obnoxious now.
# -20 happy for main leader but relationship stays the same
mainDating_outcome2_fail = [Name] says [he]'s not ready for marriage yet.\n\n
It's complex. Life is different now than it was. The whole "till death do us part" thing... well it comes into play a lot more now than it used to. Once you've felt the death of a loved one, people put up walls to avoid getting hurt like that again. They push each other away.\n\n
I think [he]'ll be ready eventually. I just have to be patient, and spend as much time with [him] as I can.
# confirm before breaking up
mainDating_outcome3 = [Name] burst into tears at the mention of us separating. Do I really want to do this?
mainDating_outcome3_option1 = Yes
mainDating_outcome3_option2 = No, stay together
# -20 happy for each, set to neutral relationship
mainDating_outcome3_outcome1 = That was hard, but it's best to end it early. We had chemistry, but [he] wasn't the one that I want to spend the rest of my life with.\n\n
I'm not sure how much time that will be, but it's precious.
# replace with this text if state was MARRIED before
mainDating_outcome3_outcome1Divorce = We married far too soon. People do that a lot these days; you think you could die tomorrow so what the heck, be impulsive, marry that person you just met.\n\n
Then you _don't_ die, and instead you keep waking up next to this person that it turns out you don't really like all that much.\n\n
[He] took it pretty well, considering. We got a couple witnesses to make it official: [FormalName] and I are now divorced.
mainDating_outcome3_outcome2 = Hehe, I meant to say we should _make out_, not _break up_. Silly me.


# main leader gets married, repeat if engaged

mainMarriage_title = White wedding
mainMarriage_picture = church
mainMarriage_pictureColin1 = true

mainMarriage = Today would be such a nice day for a wedding! Should [FormalName] and I finally tie the knot?
mainMarriage_option1 = Have a solemn event
# grey out if we don't have enough food
mainMarriage_option2 = Throw a big party (10 food)
mainMarriage_option3 = Put it off for now
# + happy
mainMarriage_outcome1 = We kept it simple, just the two of us and a few friends, a handfasting under a tree. We didn't want to make a big deal of it, since that would remind us of all the people who couldn't be there. [Name] wished especially that [his] [little sister|grandmother|parents] could have survived to see this day.\n\n
[Name] decided to keep [his] own last name. That's a bit of an outdated old tradition anyway.
# -10 food, ++ happy
mainMarriage_outcome2_picture = party
mainMarriage_outcome2 = We cooked up a feast, found enough musicians to scrape a band together and danced the night away. There were no staged photos with a professional photographer, no individually-wrapped wedding favors, no ugly bridesmaid dresses, or bouquet throwing. Just us, our friends, and some people we don't even know that well.\n\n
It was a celebration we could all take part in. A night we'll all remember.
mainMarriage_outcome3 = Why rush things? We can get married later. There's always tomorrow... assuming we live through tomorrow, right?
