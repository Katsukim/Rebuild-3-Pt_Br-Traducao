# INJURY / DEATH

# generic message when someone's injured during a mission
# other than attacking a faction or recruitment - usually while killing zombies or scavenging
missionInjury_title = Injury while [missioning]
missionInjury_picture = hospital
# reporter was also on the mission
missionInjury_1 = We were out [missioning] when we met a cute little dog. Something like a [*shih tzu|chihuahua|Pomeranian], but it's fur was so matted you couldn't tell for sure. [FormalName] bent down to offer it [his] hand, but the little dog growled and started going yap-yap-yap-yap-yap... we couldn't shut it up!\n\n
Every zed within hearing lurched over and we had to run for it. That damn dog ran with us, nipping at our heels and tripping [Name], causing [him] to twist [his] ankle.\n\n
Eventually the dog broke off to bark at the zombies instead. I hope they ate it.
missionInjury_2 = Dammit! I told [FormalName] that building didn't look structurally sound, but [he] kept insisting [he] had spotted [*something shiny|a little girl|a little boy|a vending machine full of candy] in there.\n\n
Of course, as soon as [he] went to get a closer look [*a busted old air conditioner|an ugly-lookin' gargoyle|a worn McNoodles billboard|a window planter full of dead flowers] decided that was the moment to let go of the side of the building. Came crashing down right on top [him].\n\n
[He]'ll live, but we had to abort the [missioning] mission to drag [him] and [his] dislocated shoulder back to base.
missionInjury_3 = You know how the police always used to tell us how dangerous [*old ammo is|unexploded ordnance are|firecrackers are]? [FormalName] found a discarded box of the stuff while we were [missioning] and it went off in [his] face.\n\n
I think [he] should be OK in a few days, but it will be a while before [he] [*can hear clearly in that ear again|will any  have any sort of eyebrows to speak of|stops smelling of gunpowder].
missionInjury_4 = Who the hell shuts a zed in [a fridge|a deep freezer|the back of a van|a novelty coffin|bathroom] for someone else to find? [FormalName] got the fright of [his] life when [he] opened the thing up and got a zombie to the face.\n\n
We managed to get the thing off of [him] before [he] ended up with any new teeth marks, but it's going to take [him] a few days to recover.
# shown instead if they were alone on the mission
missionInjuryAlone_1 = I'm not sure how [FormalName] managed to drag [himself] back to the fort after that botched mission, but we're happy [he]'s alive.\n\n
We still don't know what happened because [he]'s been unconscious since [he] got back, but we're pretty sure [he]'ll come around soon.
missionInjuryAlone_2 = [FormalName] somehow walked straight into a pack of zed on [his] way to start [missioning]. [He] had to lock [himself] in a parked car and stay perfectly silent and still until they passed by.\n\n
Unfortunately it's hot out and the temperature in that car was enough to give the poor [guy] a near fatal heat stroke. [He] couldn't even remember [his] name when we found [him]. [He]'ll need some time to recover.
missionInjuryAlone_3 = I still haven't been able to work out what happened to [FormalName]. [He] walked back through the front gate with a glazed look in [his] eye and nothing to show for [his] [missioning] mission. All I've been able to get out of [him] is "[*The bells! The bells!|There are four lights!|All I could see was its teeth!|It isn't meant to bend that way....|Chickens shouldn't swarm like that....]"\n\n
I'm not sure, but [he] may need a few days to recover.
missionInjuryAlone_4 = [FormalName] just came crashing into the fort covered in blood, and with a horde of undead hot on [his] heels. We managed to get gate closed in time, but [he]'s in rough shape.\n\n
I suppose that just goes to show you shouldn't [wear those squeaky/flashy kids shoes|bring your lucky tambourine with you|practice your singing|taunt the zed|get into a loud argument with your shadow] when you're out [missioning].
missionInjuryAlone_5 = I just finished bundling up [FormalName] in bed. It seems [he] was out [missioning] and tried to slip through one of the old parks when [he] ran into an angry [raccoon|elk|moose|skunk|porcupine] defending its territory.\n\n
[He] got away, but not before [he] [got some nasty scratches.|got an antler in the ribs.|was nearly trampled.|was treated to the skunk's special brand of "cologne". Ewwww.|got a leg full of needles.]

# generic message when someone's killed during a mission

missionDeath_title = Death while [missioning]
missionDeath_picture = grave
# reporter was also on the mission, body was recovered and is edible
missionDeath_1 = [FormalName] was killed while we were out [missioning]. We must have put a dozen bullets in that zombie, but it just kept coming. It got [Name] by the arm and ripped it clean off [him]. There was so much blood.\n\n
[He] was so worried about [his] arm. We kept saying "you never know, maybe we can sew it back on," and "now we'll have to call you lefty." Ha ha.\n\n
[He] bled out and died before we could even move [him]. I'm sorry, [Name].
missionDeath_2 = We stumbled on an old [*musket|flintlock pistol|civil-war era cannon|sawed-off shotgun|hunting rifle] just sitting outside in the middle of the street while we were [missioning] today. No idea how the thing got there, but between the mold and the rust it did not look like the elements had been kind to it.\n\n
Of course, that didn't necessarily mean the thing wasn't still loaded. Really wish [Name] hadn't been looking down the barrel when we found that out. Still, we were able to bring back most of [his] body. Not sure where [his] head ended up though.
missionDeath_3 = [Concrete|Metal|Wood] can get really slippery in this weather, between the damp and the slime that covers everything. We were [missioning] when [FormalName] thought [he] saw [*a birds nest|a decoder ring|some racy magazines|some top of the line sneakers] [sitting on top|hanging off|on the roof] of this [pile of rubble|bent lamppost|old shack]. We told [him] it didn't look safe, but [he] went and climbed up anyway to get a better look.\n\n
[He] wasn't even that high when [he] slipped, but [his] head split open like a [*watermelon|rotten egg|ripe tomato] when it hit the hard ground.
missionDeath_4 = We were out [missioning] yesterday when [FormalName] stumbled straight into some jury-rigged trap. It looked just like a regular ol' [*pile of leaves|store mannequin|washing machine|lawn mower|CRT monitor] but the instant [he] touched it, [*spikes flew out of it, impaling everything nearby|it exploded in a ball of greenish flame|the tripwire attached to it triggered the nearby blunderbuss full of nails and screws|barbed wire shot out of it like a coiled spring].\n\n
We brought back the bits of [him] we could find, but there wasn't much our docs could do for [him] at that point.
# reporter also on mission, body bitten/eaten/unrecoverable
missionDeathInedible_1 = [FormalName] was a good friend, and a hero in [his] final moments. We were [missioning] and just chatting, not paying enough attention. The zed were on us in seconds, appearing in the doorways on both sides of the room, seemed like out of nowhere. [Name] pushed me into a closet and slammed the door.\n\n
I could hear [him] fighting those things, but there was nothing I could do. I waited until they finished with [him] and had wandered away. There was nothing left but a smear of blood on the floor.
missionDeathInedible_2 = It always happens when you think you're finally safe. We got jumped by a bunch of undead just as we were about finish up [missioning]. They grabbed [FormalName] before we knew what was happening.\n\n
As they [*tore at|clawed at|chewed on|ripped into] [his] [*intestines|eyes|tongue|spleen|neck], [he] simply screamed at us to run. Tears in our eyes, we did.\n\n
We'll miss you, [Name]. You were a better [man] than any of us.
missionDeathInedible_3 = We've gotten so used to digging through hazardous waste out here, we don't even notice warning signs anymore. Like the [biohazard|explosive|poison|corrosive] danger symbol on the [*steel hatch|large canister|test tube|tightly sealed door] [FormalName] found while we were [missioning]. It becomes background noise.\n\n
The [purple spores|jet of flame|green gas|spray of acid] that shot out of it [turned|engulfed|saturated|ate through] [his] [skin bright yellow|head and shoulders|every pore|clothes] in seconds. That stuff devoured [him] faster than any zed. Before long all that was left was a smear on the pavement.
missionDeathInedible_4 = I was out [missioning] with [FormalName] when we decided to split up. Seemed like a good idea at the time. We could cover more ground that way. But when [he] missed the rendezvous a few hours later, I started to get worried.\n\n
Didn't take me long to find [him]. Or rather, it didn't take [him] long to find me. I hadn't realized you could be become a zed that fast, but [Name] always was an overachiever.\n\n
It was all I could do to [take off the creature's head with a shovel|smashed the thing's skull in with a brick|shove an iron spike through the zombie's eye] before it sank its teeth into me. Hurt to do, but it was [him] or me at that point.
# shown instead if they were alone on the mission, body bitten/eaten/unrecoverable
missionDeathAlone_1 = We haven't heard from [FormalName] since yesterday morning. [He] was out [missioning], but we expected [him] back for supper last night. Sometimes people get stuck out there overnight, but in this case... I don't know how I know it, but [he]'s not coming home.\n\n
[Name] is dead.
missionDeathAlone_2 = It's always hard when one of our own get turned, but our scouts caught sight of [FormalName's] corpse shambling through the wastes this morning. [His] [*face looked like it had been half melted off|leg was missing|guts were hanging out and dragging along the ground|skull was cracked open and bit of brain were oozing out] but it was definitely [him].\n\n
I'm not sure what happened on that last [missioning] mission of [his], but it doesn't look like it ended well.
missionDeathAlone_3 = I knew we should have sent someone with [FormalName] to go [missioning]. [He] always gets so [reckless|scared|careless] out in the field by [himself]....\n\n
Well, that should probably be [he] _"got"_ [reckless|scared|careless]. It's been over 24 hours and there's been no sign of [him]. That usually means someone's ended up dead.
missionDeathAlone_4 = Our wall-watchers heard [a massive explosion|a terrifying scream|the sound of collapsing building|the sound of gunfire] come from the area [FormalName] was [missioning] earlier today.\n\n
I was waiting for [Name] to get back in so we could get the full report, but it's been 8 hours and there's been no sign of [him]. I'll wait a bit longer, but if [he] doesn't show up soon we're going to have to declare another one missing/presumed dead.
missionDeathAlone_5 = [FormalName] staggered through the front gate this evening, an absolute mess. [He] was [*covered in bruises|bleeding from the stump that used to attach to a hand|beaten black and blue|drenched in blood] and could barely stand.\n\n
It wasn't until I was cleaning [him] up that we noticed the bite marks. We both understood what that meant. I left [him] alone in [his] room with a pistol and a single bullet. I'll clean up the mess in there tomorrow.
missionDeathAlone_6 = I went out looking for [FormalName] this morning. [He] was still missing after going [missioning] yesterday. I was just hoping I could get to [him] before the zed could.\n\n
I never managed to find [his] body, but I did find [his] [*old camcorder|necklace|girl-power T-shirt|ear|hair gel] floating by itself in a mud puddle not far from where [he] had been working. I guess that will have to do if we want something to bury.

# someone injured while attacking a faction fort or unit
factionMissionAttackInjury_title = Injury during Attack
factionMissionAttackInjury_picture = hospital
factionMissionAttackInjury_1 = I for one would be proud to take a bullet in this fight against [faction]. They're a menace and they need to be destroyed. It's that simple. But [FormalName] won't stop griping about the bullet in [his] [leg|arm|shoulder], now that it's clear [he]'s not going to die.\n\n
[He] says [he] regrets ever attacking [faction's] fort, and doesn't understand why we wanted to do it. Maybe some bed rest will give [him] time to figure it out.
factionMissionAttackInjury_2 = [FormalName] was injured today in an attack on [faction] at their [square]. We really messed those guys up though, and no doubt [Name] will be first in line for another shot at them once [he]'s healed up.
factionMissionAttackInjury_3 = None of us expected [faction] to fight back so hard. I really thought we had them at our attack on their [square], but they knew we were coming and had the place mined with nail bombs.\n\n
[FormalName] stepped on one and it took a chunk of [his] [calf|thigh|knee] that... well I hope it grows back. Is that possible? Well, [he] might have a bit of a limp from now on.
factionMissionAttackInjury_4 = Getting through their wall was too easy. Some [factionAdjective] builder must have been half in the bag when they made it... there were cracks you could practically walk through. [FormalName] went first of course. [He] always insists on going first... and there they were, ready to take [his] head off as [he] came through.\n\n
Luckily, [Name] spotted a penny on the ground and stooped over just in time to pick it up. [He]'s still rather badly bludgeoned, but alive. [He]'ll recover in a few days.
factionMissionAttackInjury_5 = [FormalName] is seriously lucky just to be alive right now. Three of the [factionAdjective] got on [him] in there during the attack on their base. They swarmed [him] like a pack of zombies. I swear to god one of them even bit [his] face. But [he] got out of there somehow.\n\n
Besides missing half an ear now [he] should be fully recovered in a few days.

# someone killed while attacking a faction fort or unit
factionMissionAttackDeath_title = Death during Attack
factionMissionAttackDeath_picture = grave
factionMissionAttackDeath_1 = We stormed in there like it was D-day, only with, well, a slightly smaller scale. But this is war nonetheless, and [FormalName] gave [his] life today on the battlefield at the [factionAdjective] [square]. May it not have been in vain.
factionMissionAttackDeath_2 = [FormalName] was killed today during our attack on [faction]. [He] fought bravely and never questioned what we were doing there, but when [he] came face to face with a young [factionAdjective] [boy|girl], [he] hesitated. The kid was clearly terrified out of [his|her] mind, but with trembling hands shot [Name] before he could react.\n\n
As [he] lay dying, [Name] whispered that [he] was glad [he] hadn't pulled the trigger, and he hoped that [boy|girl] survives us all.
factionMissionAttackDeath_3 = Why are we fighting this war with [faction]? Is it worth all the bloodshed? Human blood; decent, redeemable humans fighting for ideals or honor or territory. We're not animals, not zombies.\n\n
I'm feeling pretty down today because [FormalName] was killed during an attack on [faction]. It's not too late to make peace with them and end this fighting.
factionMissionAttackDeath_4 = "They started it."\n\n
This is what [FormalName] told me when I asked if [he] had a problem joining the attack on [faction], where [he] died today. The [man] fought like a demon and must have taken 5 of them down with [him], but those words keep haunting me.\n\n
What if they didn't start it? What if they think we did?

# someone injured while raiding a faction fort
factionMissionRaidInjury_title = Injury during Raid
factionMissionRaidInjury_picture = hospital
factionMissionRaidInjury_1 = [FormalName] took a bullet during our raid on [faction]. [He]'ll be fine in a few days, but [he] dropped the stolen [sack of flour|bag of rice|case of canned food] [he] was carrying out of there. That could have fed us for a week. Ah well.
factionMissionRaidInjury_2 = [Faction] was ready for us when we raided them. They left one of their storeroom doors enticingly open and we couldn't resist the trap. [FormalName] hurried in ahead of the rest of us, probably planning to pocket the best stuff before we got there.\n\n
Anyway they jumped [him], and beat the living crap out of [him] before [he] got away. [He] needs a couple days to recover.
factionMissionRaidInjury_3 = We were heroically raiding [faction's] [square] when [FormalName] suddenly had an attack of conscience. "Do we really need to take their medicine?" [he] asked me. We stopped to argue, and predictably that was when they jumped us.\n\n
[Name's] going to be fine, but [he]'s got a nasty concussion. Hopefully they knocked some sense into [him] in the process.

# someone killed while raiding a faction fort
factionMissionRaidDeath_title = Death during Raid
factionMissionRaidDeath_picture = grave
factionMissionRaidDeath_1 = I'm so sorry to say that [FormalName] has died. [He] was out raiding the [factionAdjective] [square], which was supposed to be an in-and-out job. They shouldn't have even known [he]'d taken anything until tomorrow. But something went wrong, like it always does.
factionMissionRaidDeath_2 = We should never have pitted ourselves against [faction]. They're ferocious as wolverines when their backs are to the wall, and we put them in that position by trying to steal the last of their [food|fuel].\n\n
[FormalName] was shot during the raid. We unfortunately couldn't recover [his] corpse, but hope that [faction] won't be too cruel with it. At the very least, we hope they'll make sure [he] stays dead.
factionMissionRaidDeath_3 = [FormalName] was murdered by [factionAdjective] dogs today. Literally, by their dogs. It was pretty horrible. One of them seemed rabid, or maybe it had the disease, the way it kept fighting even after [Name] cut one of its legs off. By the time those beasts were done with [him], there wasn't much of our old friend.

# someone killed while recovering from injury square was lost

recoveryDeath_title = Killed while recovering from injury

recoveryDeath_1 = [Name] was killed when the [square] [he] was recovering on was lost. [He] was too sick to move...

fightOrFlight_title = Fight or Flight
fightOrFlight_picture = sunset
fightOrFlight_pictureColin = true
fightOrFlight = [FormalName] got careless and forgot the knock test: always knock on a door first and listen for movement on the other side before turning the knob.\n\n
Zed poured out when [he] opened it. A panicked chase, a wrong turn down a hallway, a locked door in the stairwell, and [he] found [himself] on the roof with two choices:\n\n
Leap off and hope something breaks [his] fall, or fight the zombies bare-handed.
fightOrFlight_option1 = Jump off the roof
fightOrFlight_option2 = Fight the zombies
fightOrFlight_outcome1 = Something did break [Name's] fall: [his] legs.\n\n
Yup, that hurt a lot, and [he]'ll be out of commission for awhile until [his] legs heal... but [he]'s been obnoxiously happy since it happened. I guess [he] was so sure [he] was going to die up on that roof. Just getting to see the sun rise one more time is a gift.
fightOrFlight_outcome2 = Give the [guy] some credit: [he] fought the lot of them off with nothing but [his] bare fists. [He] threw three of them off the roof, using their own momentum against them. The last one [he] tripped, then kicked its head until it was nothing but a grey-pink smear.\n\n
Sadly, [Name] was bitten. Not once, but half a dozen times. It's only a matter of time now before [he] turns.
fightOrFlight_outcome2_option1 = Wait and see...
# 50/50 roll, half the time he dies, half the time he becomes immune
fightOrFlight_outcome2_outcome1success_picture = happy
fightOrFlight_outcome2_outcome1success = [He] didn't die! We were all so sure, we'd started prepping for [his] funeral. My eulogy was going to be so good, too. But the fever, which usually sets in within a few hours of being bitten, never came to [Name]. [He] sat and meditated in [his] room all night, then emerged just as healthy as the day before.\n\n
[He] must have some sort of immunity to the disease. Lucky!
fightOrFlight_outcome2_outcome1success_effect = Gained Immunity perk
fightOrFlight_outcome2_outcome1fail_picture = grave
fightOrFlight_outcome2_outcome1fail = [Name] didn't make it through the night. When the fever gripped [him], [he] asked that I be the one to... finish it... after [he] died.\n\n
We're all going to miss [him] around here. Farewell [Name].

# FACTION MISSIONS - ATTACK AND RAID
######################################

factionMissionAttack_title = Attacked [faction]
factionMissionAttack_picture = [factionBackground]
factionMissionAttack_pictureColin = false
factionMissionAttack_1 = [Faction] never saw us coming. We stormed through their wall like [a herd of triceratops|vengeful gods|a lightning bolt through butter] and zombies poured in after us. We killed [4 or 5|5 or 6|7] defenders and generally messed up their day.
factionMissionAttack_2 = [Faction] may hate us, but more importantly they fear us. Our soldiers brought that fear today when they blasted through the [factionAdjective] gates and chased them out of there.
factionMissionAttack_3 = [factionAdjective] defenses were impressive, but they didn't stand a chance against our soldiers. We busted our way into their compounded and [gunned down|lynched|trusted up|beat down|tarred, feathered, and left to the zed] anyone who raised a weapon against us, before heading out the way we came.\n\n
[Faction] won't be happy, but should think twice before messing with us again.
factionMissionAttack_4 = A few of our sneakier people slipped passed [factionAdjective] walls last night and [set fire to one of their main buildings|tainted their water supply|poisoned their food stocks|slit the throats of the guards on duty|let a swarm of bed bugs loose in their bunks] while most of them were asleep.\n\n
We'll see how well they sleep tomorrow when [they find the charred corpses|the dysentery begins|a few of them fall face first into their breakfasts|they stumble on the bloody remains|they wake up all itchy] come the morning.
factionMissionAttack_5 = Using a few makeshift [*ladders|grappling hooks|siege engines] we scaled [factionAdjective] walls and [*opened up a can of whoop ass on|started hurling rocks down at|began hunting down|went toe-to-toe with] the defenders inside.\n\n
The fight was [*short and bloody|long and ugly|rough on our people|over a lot quicker than expected] but [faction] will remember the [*chaos|mess|bodies|broken bones] we left behind. If they know what's good for them, that is.

# we didn't manage to take down their walls but killed some of them
#factionMissionAttackFail_1 = They fought back harder than we expected. The gunfight at the [square] went on for hours, with one side gaining ground then the other taking it back. Eventually we just gave up in exhaustion and went home. I'm pretty sure we killed at least a couple of them, and we wasted a lot of their bullets.
#factionMissionAttackFail_2 = The good news is, nobody was hurt. Well, none of our people were hurt. Most of the [factionAdjective] defenders got pretty messed up in one way or another so they won't be fighting at full strength for a while. We weren't able to take the [square], but at least we did some damage.
#factionMissionAttackFail_3 = The fight was hard, but we had [*truth|justice|honor] on our side. And [bullets|explosives|knives|psychos]. A lot of [bullets|explosives|knives|psychos].\n\n
#I still wish we had managed to taken the [square], but 'least we left more than a few [factionAdjective] survivors with [*black eyes|missing teeth|holes in their vital organs].
#factionMissionAttackFail_4 = We couldn't manage to break into [factionAdjective] fort this time round. That said, none of us expected for [FactionLeader] to be manning the defenses themselves.\n\n
#After several hours of [*firing ineffectively|charging futilely|yelling insults] at [FactionLeader]'s [*defenders|walls|gun placements] we were forced to call it quits. I think we may have hurt a couple of their people, but all in all, the day was wash.
#factionMissionAttackFail_5 = It's been a long time since I've seen that much carnage. Both our people and the [factionAdjective] soldiers fighting desperately for control of what few resources the [square] provided. [The area was a sea of blood, bones and guts|Bullets filled the air like swarms of lethal mosquitoes|The zed will be eating well tonight].\n\n
#In the end we were forced to leave with our tail between our legs. That said, I'm pretty sure more than of a few of their injured won't last to see the sunrise.

# replaces result when we take the last faction square, you can kill them all or be merciful
factionMissionAttackDestroyed_1 = We've defeated [faction]. They were huddling in the [square], low on supplies, their last remaining walls thrown together in such a hurry they could barely hold out the undead.\n\n
But it wasn't zed who put an end to these people, it was us. What should we do with them?
factionMissionAttackDestroyed_2 = [Faction] are defeated. They hardly put up a fight in their last [square]... I guess they knew it was over and were just waiting for us to come and put an end to it.\n\n
We've torn down their walls and are holding the last of them captive. What should we do with them?
factionMissionAttackDestroyed_3 = [Faction] put up a serious fight in their final [square]. We surrounded the walls and demanded they surrender. They answered with gunfire. I guess they'd rather go out with guns blazing than submit to us. Hell, I can understand that.\n\n
The smarter ones laid their guns down and put their hands up. What should we do with them?
factionMissionAttackDestroyed_option1 = Kill them all
factionMissionAttackDestroyed_option2 = Let them go
factionMissionAttackDestroyed_option3 = Invite them to join us
factionMissionAttackDestroyed_outcome1 = I'm not proud of the things we've done to survive in this new world. Theft. Murder. Genocide. But we're doing what we must to build a new future for humanity.\n\n
We didn't find [FactionLeader] among the bodies, but the rest of [faction] are dead. We took what supplies they had on them.
factionMissionAttackDestroyed_outcome2 = We gave [FactionLeader] and the rest of them as much food as they could carry, then ordered them to leave [CityName] and never look back.\n\n
They looked pretty downhearted as they trudged out of town, but our people are happy we let them live.
factionMissionAttackDestroyed_outcome3 = Two [factionAdjective] survivors joined us. They figure it was either that or die in the jaws of the undead. I'd have made the same choice.\n\n
They're depressed, and it'll take them a while to warm up to the others here, but we can always use more zombie fodder... I mean able bodies.\n\n
[FactionLeader] and the rest of [faction] said they'd rather take their chances with the Zed. They took what they could carry and left, promising to leave [CityName] and never come back.

factionMissionHeadquarters_1 = Today we hit them where it hurts: right in the [square]. [Faction] should have known better than to keep all their war supplies and tactical records in the big, obvious building that practically screamed "headquarters".\n\n
We didn't raze it to the ground because hey, we could use that [square] ourselves. But we made sure to remove every trace of [Faction] from it, and we took {1}.
factionMissionHeadquarters_2 = I took particular delight in destroying [FactionLeader's] office when we stormed their headquarters in the [square] today. If they ever manage to take it back, [factionHe]'s going to find some pretty hilarious graffiti in there.\n\n
They seem to be pretty demoralized by losing the building, and the stuff we found: {1}.
factionMissionHeadquarters_3 = It was no easy battle getting through the defenses at the [square], but that just made us fight all the harder. We knew there had to be something good in there, and we were right. We found {1}.\n\n
[Faction] took a real hit to their tactical strength today. The war should be easier from here on out.

factionMissionRaid_pictureColin = false
# 2+ people on the mission including the one mentioned and the (usually more senior) one talking
# {1} is a list of stuff like "5 ammo and 15 food"
factionMissionRaid_1 = We stole {1} during the raid on the [factionAdjective] fort. It was easy! First we set up a distraction by having [Name] run around on the other side of their fort [yelling obscenities|with no pants]. Then we climbed over the fence at the [square] and were out of there before they realized what had happened.
factionMissionRaid_2 = Zombies can't climb ladders. Actually it's hilarious to watch them try, but the point is the [factionAdjective] walls were built for zombies, and they weren't imagining humans coming over them. This makes stealing from them remarkably easy, so long as you find a section of wall with no guards on duty.\n\n
Last night we got away with {1}.
factionMissionRaid_3 = Some raids go better than others. This time, [faction] were on us within minutes of our getting there, and we got caught in a firefight. We still managed to take {1} out with us though. I've been practicing shooting while carrying a 40 pound sack of potatoes and today I think it paid off.
factionMissionRaid_4 = Our scavenging skills were put to the test during the raid on [faction]. Either they're running out of supplies, or they've hidden them really, really well, because we practically turned that [square] upside down to find {1}.\n\n
I don't think they were too happy about it either, the way they were shooting at us.
factionMissionRaid_5 = A proper raid takes skill to pull off. Not just skill with a gun, though that's important, but the skill to figure out where to strike... and how to get in and out with the most loot before [faction] figure out what's going on and retaliate. It's all about careful planning and scavenger's intuition.\n\n
Today my scavenger's intuition netted us {1}.
# only one guy on the mission, the reporter is someone who stayed home, usually the main leader
factionMissionRaidAlone_pictureColin = true
factionMissionRaidAlone_1 = [Name] brought back {1} from that raid on [faction]. The way [he] tells it, [he] just walked up to the gates, shot one guard in the knee, then told a second one to bring as many supplies as [he|she] could carry. I can't believe that worked!
factionMissionRaidAlone_2 = [Faction] are such suckers. [Name] single-handedly raided {1} from them today, and tore open part of their wall in the process. That'll take a while to fix.
factionMissionRaidAlone_3 = [FormalName] says [he] feels bad for stealing from [faction]. Thanks to [his] scavenging skills [he] brought back {1} from their fort, but [he] had a confrontation on the way out. [He] says the [woman|man] who tried to stop [him] didn't even have a gun, they just begged [him] not to take their hard earned supplies.
factionMissionRaidAlone_4 = Sounds like [Name] really terrorized [faction] today. [He] raided their supplies, coming away with {1}. When they tried to stop [him], [he] killed two of them. The rest backed off and let [him] go.
# nothing to steal
factionMissionRaidNothing_1 = [Faction] had nothing left to steal. We should give 'em some time to replenish their supplies before we try to hit them again.
factionMissionRaidNothing_2 = Couldn't find a single thing left to take from [faction] during that raid. I told him the next time we come back they better have something for us, and beat the hell out of one poor sod to drive the threat home.
factionMissionRaidNothing_3 = [Faction] just laughed when [we] raided them today. Looks like they've got nothing left to lose. They can barely even feed themselves... I guess our raiding's really taken it's toll on the poor sods.\n\n
We should give it a rest and come back when they've got something worth taking.

# {1} is raiders/attackers/merchants/saboteurs
factionMissionAttackUnit_title = Killed {1}
factionMissionAttackUnit_picture = street
factionMissionAttackUnit_pictureColin = false
factionMissionAttackUnit_1 = [We] nailed those [factionAdjective] {1}. [We] came down on them at dawn while they were still camped at the [square], and the element of surprise was all [we] needed.
factionMissionAttackUnit_2 = [We] ended up in a drawn out gunfight with those [factionAdjective] {1}, but they were obviously outmatched. After [we] picked off the first couple, the rest ran back towards their base. We'll have to take the fight there if we want to finish them off.
factionMissionAttackUnit_3 = The [factionAdjective] {1} were pinned down at that [square] all day. At one point I was sure they'd snuck past [us] somehow and got away, but at sunset they made a break for it. [We] shot one of them in the back and another in the shoulder, but [he|she] ran off with the rest of them. They'll think twice before trying to get the drop on us again.
# we didn't manage to kill the unit but did damage their strength
factionMissionAttackUnitFail_title = Attack Failed
factionMissionAttackUnitFail_1 = The [factionAdjective] {1} were camping out at a dilapidated [square] when [we] jumped them. I thought [we] had the advantage, but they were surprisingly quick to grab their weapons and fight back. [We] wounded a couple of them, but when they got a sniper up into a nearby building it was over for us. We could try again later.
factionMissionAttackUnitFail_2 = We'll have to try to attack the [factionAdjective] {1} again somewhere else. [We] spent most of the morning laying in wait for them to show up, but it seems they were on to [us] and took another route. Oops.
factionMissionAttackUnitFail_3 = [We] stormed up to those [factionAdjective] {1} and showed no mercy. One of them, this huge [chick|dude], shot a hole through my sleeve but it only grazed the skin. [She|He] was always one step ahead of [us], blocking every advantage, shooting the weapons out of [our] [p|hand|hands]. [She|He] had skills, serious skills.\n\n
I rounded a corner and suddenly [she|he] was there in front of me. I thought I was a goner for sure, but [she|he] just said "Get the hell out of here." So [we] did.

# the first time the rotten are attacked/raided, it fails and their fort grows
rottenExplode_title = Rotten Explosion
rottenExplode_picture = rotten
rottenExplode_pictureColin = rotten
rottenExplode_1 = [Our] attack on the Rotten's subway station triggered something catastrophic. Suddenly there were Rotten soldiers coming out of the sewer grates all around [us]. Oh god... there were more than we imagined living down there.\n\n
They took the {1}, the {2}... everything. Jesse strode through the streets with his antique six-shooters, the figure of a vengeful Josey Wales, a western outlaw preparing to make his last stand.\n\n
It won't be today. It's a miracle [we] got out of there alive. We should think twice before going back in.

# protected factions can't be reduced to less than two squares
factionMissionAttackProtected_title = Attack Canceled
factionMissionAttackProtected_picture = [factionBackground]
factionMissionAttackProtected_pictureColin = false
factionMissionAttackProtected_1 = We've reduced [Faction] to the point that they're helpless before us. We'd better not finish them off though. We need them alive for what's coming.

factionTradeUnit_title = Trade with [faction]
factionTradeUnit_picture = gate
factionTradeUnit_pictureColin = [factionLeader]
factionTradeUnit_1 = [We] went out to meet the [factionAdjective] caravan and see what they have for sale. [FactionLeader] happened to be there, "making sure nobody steals anything" as [factionHe] put it.
factionTradeUnit_2 = [FactionLeader] led the trade caravan (actually [an old gutted RV|a convoy of pickup trucks|a school bus with large guns mounted on the top]) to a big parking lot and opened up shop.
factionTradeUnit_option1 = Trade
factionTradeUnit_option2 = Ask if they need anything (lvl 5 leader)
factionTradeUnit_option3 = Leave
factionTradeUnitAskYes_1 = [FactionLeader] didn't want to give anything away so [factionHe] brushed me off, but it's clear from looking at their supplies that they're low on _{1}_. I bet they'd pay extra if we could spare any.
factionTradeUnitAskYes_2 = [FactionHe] said they've had trouble getting enough _{1}_ and would be happy to pay extra for any we have.
factionTradeUnitAskYes_3 = "We're nearly out of _{1}_," offered one of the caravan workers. "We had a whole shipment coming in from another town, but it never showed. Probably out there somewhere getting picked over by scavengers. I bet the boss would pay nearly double for it."\n\n
If [FactionLeader] overheard, [factionHe] didn't say anything.
factionTradeUnitAskNo_1 = "Nope" answered [FactionLeader], watching my eyes closely. I'm not sure if [factionHe]'s telling the truth or not, but it's clear we won't be getting any deals that easily. We'll have to wait until they restock and ask again.
factionTradeUnitAskNo_2 = "Why, what is it you have too much of?" [FactionLeader] asked slyly. I guess I'm not getting an answer out of [factionHim]. We should try asking again next week once they've had a chance to restock.
# replace above if trading at a faction's fort
factionTradeFort_picture = [FactionBackground]
factionTradeFort_pictureColin1 = [FactionLeader]
factionTradeFort_1 = [We] met with [FactionLeader] at [faction's] compound. After a few pleasantries, [factionHe] led us to one of their storerooms so we could have a look at what they're willing to trade this week.
factionTradeFort_2 = [FactionLeader] brought in a [*stout|red-headed|fabulously dressed] [man|woman] with a clipboard to list off goods they're able to trade.
factionTradeFort_3 = [Faction] obviously have much more than they're willing to trade us. I mentioned this to [FactionLeader] but [factionHe] said they were "reserve" and had to be saved in case [Faction] needed them someday.
factionTradeFort_4 = [FactionLeader] walked [us] around their storerooms and pointed out a few things that we could have for a price. Hopefully my bartering skills are up to the task!

# intro but for gustav, same options
# {1} resource they want to buy
factionTradeGustav_title = Trade with Gustav
factionTradeGustav_picture = [factionBackground]
factionTradeGustav_pictureColin = [factionLeader]
factionTradeGustav_1 = Gustav jumped down from the lead truck and shook my hand vigorously in both of his. _"Iz good day for deal!"_ he shouted, then slapped a meaty arm around my shoulders. _"Come, I show you what I find, many good things for you..."_
factionTradeGustav_2 = Gustav was in a somber mood when I met him at the caravan. _"Greetinks friend,"_ he said, _"Too much mertsi, too many walking deadmen in [CityName] today. Two guards I lost zis mornink."_ He held up two fingers, then considered them. _"Well, now I sell you zeir stuff, so for you, I think iz not so bad."_
factionTradeGustav_option1 = Trade
factionTradeGustav_option2 = Ask if he needs anything (lvl 5 leader)
factionTradeGustav_option3 = Leave
factionTradeGustavAskYes_1 = _"Not for me,"_ said Gustav, _"but iz many people who will buy _{1}_ from my caravan. I will give you a good price for it."_
factionTradeGustavAskYes_2 = _"Yez,"_ Gustav answered, _"I have much need for {1}, but I will not say why. Only that I will pay double if you can sell it to me."_
factionTradeGustavAskNo_1 = Gustav seemed to be about to say something, then he just shook his head no. No deals today. Gustav's stock seems to change about once a week, so we can check again then.



# trade was successful (at fort or with unit)
factionTrade_title = Trade Accepted
factionTrade_picture = [factionBackground]
factionTrade_pictureColin = [factionLeader]
# an average deal
factionTrade_1 = [We] eventually came to a deal with [faction] that seemed to suit us both well enough. I think we could have gotten more out of them, but this way everybody's happy.
factionTrade_2 = [Faction] had some [80's Transformer toys|Toblerone bars|cases of homebrew beer|manga graphic novels] on them that they swore were for personal use and refused to trade. Man, [I would have given my left arm for some|what I would do for some of those]...
factionTrade_3 = They always say that you know you got a fair deal when no one goes away happy. I don't think there's going to be celebrations on either side tonight, but both us and [faction] got the stuff we needed.
factionTrade_4 = [We] probably could have gotten more out of that deal with [faction] if we had a bit more time to negotiate, but we had to cut things short when the zed suddenly [grabbed one of their bodyguards|started climbing up out of the sewers|went after their pack animals].\n\n
As it stands I think we both got what we needed off that deal. Not counting the loss of their [soldier|trader|mule], of course.
factionTrade_5 = [FactionLeader] was a hard sell, but we bartered hard and got a good deal out of [factionHim]. [FactionHe] may not be happy with the trade we gave [factionHim], but I can tell [factionHe] respects us for it.
# deal was good for faction
factionTradeGoodDeal_1 = [Faction] were happy with the great deal we gave them. That's fine, if we're generous now that we can afford it, they may return the favor if we're ever in need in the future.
factionTradeGoodDeal_2 = Damn, we gave [faction] way too good a deal this time. I guess we did make them like us more, but I definitely could have gotten more out of them if I tried.
factionTradeGoodDeal_3 = You know, looking back on it, I kind of think we got ripped off on that deal. But [faction] were just so convincing with their [wide smiles and warm handshakes|bright signs and big words|slicked back hair and dark glasses].
factionTradeGoodDeal_4 = Sometimes you've got to take one for the team, and this is one of those times. I know we could have gotten a better deal from [faction] but them liking us is more important right now. Last thing we need is to be fighting both them and the zed.
factionTradeGoodDeal_5 = OK, yeah, [we] gave [faction] a great deal, but they had agreed to throw in [that fancy gold watch|nearly a dozen video game cartridges|a bushel of fruit|half a dozen cases of beer] as part of the whole thing. How [were] [we] to know [the watch was broken|we didn't have a working TV|it was all made of wax|they had all gone bad]?
# we gave faction free stuff (there is no opposite)
factionTradeGift_1 = [Faction] were really stoked about our donation to their cause. Hah, joke's on them, that was just some useless old junk we didn't need anymore.
factionTradeGift_2 = We generously gave [faction] some free stuff. We really are good people, you know. I don't understand why everyone doesn't realize this. It would make things so much easier.
factionTradeGift_3 = We gave [faction] a bunch of supplies for free. Sure, we could have probably used the stuff ourselves, but we really need all the help we can get out here.
factionTradeGift_4 = I learned from a very young age, if you want to make friends, you've got to buy 'em. Bring [*some cool action figures|a few sweet comics|a bunch of cute dolls|plenty of candy] to the playground and before you know it, everyone wants to be your friend.\n\n
And that's what we're doing with our latest deal with [faction]. Give out a few free bobbles and we'll soon have them eating out of the palms of our hands.
factionTradeGift_5 = It was kind of painful giving away that stuff for free, but hopefully this means [faction] won't try to hurt us anymore. Last thing I need is to wake up with another [*gun barrel|pea shooter|butcher's knife|hob-nailed boot] in my face.
# any of the above but leader was particularly skilled (and is mentioned, not reporting)
factionTradeGoodLeader_1 = [Name] really is a good leader, you know. [Faction] really, really like [him]. I don't think they even care what kind of deal they get, so long as [he] smiles and tells them it's the best we can do, they believe [him].
factionTradeGoodLeader_2 = [FormalName] sure has a gift for the gab. From the sound of it, all it took was [*a couple of choice words|some thorough ego stroking|a couple of complimentary chocolate bars] and [Name] had [faction] wrapped around [his] pinkie.
factionTradeGoodLeader_3 = I've always known [FormalName] was talented at getting on people's good side, but the time [he] spent with [faction] was truly impressive. By the time [he] was done, they could have believed [he] had [*laid the foundation of the Vegas strip|killed 1000 zed|built the CN tower|raised the Titanic] all by [himself].

# an average deal
factionTradeSuccessGustav_1 = I think we got a pretty fair deal from Gustav, but the way he was leering and chuckling to himself you'd think he was pulling one over on us.
factionTradeSuccessGustav_2 = Gustav smiled broadly, a twinkle in his eyes. _"Iz nice doink business with you sometime."_
# deal was good for faction
factionTradeGoodDealGustav_1 = Gustav was practically dancing around, so happy to get a good trade out of us. It's obvious the man lives for times like this.
factionTradeGoodDealGustav_2 = We bartered with Gustav for nearly an hour over little glasses of strong, sweet black tea that he kept topped up from a big thermos. Not sure if it was the caffeine but I was feeling really good about everything and was happy to give Gustav quite a bit more than his goods were worth.
# we gave faction free stuff (there is no opposite)
factionTradeGiftGustav_1 = Gustav was actually a little choked up about receiving a gift from us. _"Nobody gives me nice think like dis,"_ he said, _"I will remember, my good friend"_.
factionTradeGiftGustav_2 = Gustav was impressed with our gift. In thanks he shared a few swigs of his vodka with me. Strong stuff!
# any of the above but leader was particularly skilled (and is mentioned, not reporting)
factionTradeGoodLeaderGustav_1 = [FormalName] really is a good barterer, you know. Gustav really, really likes [him]. I don't think he even cares what kind of deal he gets, so long as [Name] smiles and tells him it's the best we can do, he believes [him].
factionTradeGoodLeaderGustav_2 = [FormalName] sure has a gift for the gab. From the sound of it, all it took was [*a couple of choice words|some thorough ego stroking|a couple of complimentary chocolate bars] and [Name] had Gustav wrapped around [his] pinkie.
factionTradeGoodLeaderGustav_3 = I've always known [FormalName] was talented at getting on people's good side, but the time [he] spent with Gustav was truly impressive. By the time [he] was done, Gustav could have believed [he]'d [*laid the foundation of the Vegas strip|killed 1000 zed|built the CN tower|raised the Titanic] all by [himself].

# someone with the negotiator perk was trading and got extra stuff (at fort or with unit)
factionTradeNegotiator_title = Trade Bonus
factionTradeNegotiator_picture = [factionBackground]
factionTradeNegotiator_pictureColin = [factionLeader]
factionTradeNegotiator_1 = Seems like [FormalName's] got bartering in [his] blood and nobody can resist [his] salesman charm. [Faction] offered to throw in something extra to the trade. What should we ask for?
factionTradeNegotiator_2 = I've never seen such a salesman as [FormalName]. The [man]'s a natural... I bet [he] could sell life insurance to a zombie.\n\n
Today [he] got [faction] to throw in a little something extra to a trade. What do we want?
factionTradeNegotiator_option1 = Food
factionTradeNegotiator_option2 = Building Materials
factionTradeNegotiator_option3 = Gasoline
factionTradeNegotiator_option4 = Nah, they can keep it
factionTradeNegotiator_outcome1 = [Faction] happily threw in {1} [rations|bags of potatoes|unlabeled cans of mystery food] for us.
factionTradeNegotiator_outcome2 = They added some 2x4s and cement to our deal.
factionTradeNegotiator_outcome3 = [Faction] threw in a couple big mason jars of fuel to the trade.
factionTradeNegotiator_outcome4 = [Name] insisted we didn't need anything more, that we were just happy to have a good relationship with [faction]. As they struck the deal, [FactionLeader] smiled broadly and shook [Name's] hand for nearly 30 seconds. It was a little weird.


# pig farmers get special results the first 3 times you successfully trade with them
pigSellSubtle_title = The Other White Meat
pigSellSubtle_1 = The weird Pig Farmers we traded with handed us the pork through the side hatch of their battered ice cream truck. I'm still surprised anyone has any food left these days, let alone this delicious freshly butchered meat.\n\n
Funny color, but smells like heaven when you roast it. Mmmm bacon!
pigSellSubtle_2 = The greasy, pale Pig Farmers we traded with put me off with their constant chuckling, but they claim to be just a few honest guys offloading some of their spare meat.\n\n
They'll even drive it right to our main gates in their old ice cream truck. Here I thought food delivery was a thing of the past!
pigSellSubtle_3 = Tonight we ate well for the first time in six months. The Pig Farmers' meat tasted funny, but who can remember how pork's supposed to taste?
# second trade (more hints)
pigSellDubious_title = The Other White Meat
pigSellDubious_1 = We traded with those pale, creepy Pig Farmers again. They tittered and wouldn't make eye contact as usual. I still don't trust them, but maybe trust is a luxury we can't afford anymore...\n\n
The important thing is we aren't going hungry for a while, thanks to this odd-tasting "pork" of theirs.
pigSellDubious_2 = We got another chance to buy pork from those creepy Pig Farmers. They must have saved a hundred of pigs from the zombies to have this much meat to sell. Not sure where else you would find a supply of pigs these days. Maybe they're running wild in the forest?\n\n
Come to think of it, this meat does taste kind of gamey...
pigSellDubious_3 = The Pig Farmers' pork still smells sort of funny, but they assure us we won't find better meat anywhere in [CityName]. They're probably right... this is way better than the rats and pigeons I've eaten.\n\n
	WAY better.
pigSellDubious_4 = You know, I've always found it weird, our relationship with pigs. Like back in the day, doctors would practice medical procedures on pigs because their insides are so similar to us humans.\n\n
Not sure why that jumped to mind. Anyway, we bought more meat off those pig farmers today. Just butchered too, it doesn't get any fresher than this.
# third trade (don't ask questions)
pigSellObvious_title = The Other Other White Meat
pigSellObvious_1 = We traded with those creepy Pig Farmers again. [Name] says the meat we bought doesn't look like pig and [he] refuses to eat it. I told [him] to shut the hell up before [he] gets everyone else upset about it. Not all of us can be that picky.\n\n
Finding something to eat is a matter of life or death these days. Thanks to this meat we're staying on the happy side of that line. We shouldn't screw things up by asking questions about where it comes from.
pigSellObvious_2 = According to the Pig Farmers, the latest batch of pork is so fresh you can almost hear it speak. Not sure why they had to put it like that. Man those guys are creepy.\n\n
Honestly, this meat doesn't really taste like pork at all... but whatever it is it's keeping us alive and that's what matters. It's best we don't ask questions about what goes on at that pig farm of theirs.

bathSaltsActive_title = Bath Salts
bathSaltsActive_1 = The Pharmacists sure make some potent stuff! These Bath Salts will help us overcome the fears that are often much more dangerous than the zombies themselves. We'll keep it in our armory with the ammo and let survivors use it as needed before they head into a fight.\n\n
Hopefully everyone will use it responsibly and we won't see any side effects...

# only possible if you start two missions at once
factionTradeTooSoon_title = Too soon to trade
factionTradeTooSoon_picture = [factionBackground]
factionTradeTooSoon_pictureColin = [factionLeader]
factionTradeTooSoon = [Faction] aren't ready to meet with us again yet. And it was obvious they really didn't want to trade... in fact they'd only speak to me through a slot in the door. When I started listing off what we had to trade, the guard yelled "[no solicitors!|we don't want any!]" and slammed that slot shut so fast it almost took my nose off.

# if we don't have a city hall there are no options just +1 respect
factionMeetEarly = We need a proper city hall and a government before we can have any real diplomatic relationship with [Faction]. For now we chatted with [FactionLeader] a little and let [factionHim] poke fun at our fort.

# specific to every faction
# don't need more unhappy variations because they're more rare
factionMeet_riffs_happy_1 = Malik seemed pleased to meet with [us]. I think. At least he kept his sword in its sheath this time. We sat cross-legged across a low table, and he poured [us] tiny cup after tiny cup of green tea while we talked.
factionMeet_riffs_happy_2 = I'm not sure if Malik was meditating for those two hours [we] [were] waiting for him, or if he's just able to sleep sitting up.\n\n
Once he did acknowledge [our] presence he seemed happy to see us. He even invited [us] to see his [Zen garden... an impressive collection of rocks and sand|koi pond. I didn't see any koi, but the blue heron sitting in the middle of it looked really happy|knife collection. I don't think it was meant as a threat, but it's hard to tell with Malik].
factionMeet_riffs_happy_3 = Malik must have been exercising just before [we] arrived... or maybe he just likes walking around shirtless and glistening with sweat. [Either way, it was a little distracting|I restrained myself from starting a game of tic-tac-toe in the sweat on his abs|He idly made his pecs dance as we chatted].
factionMeet_riffs_unhappy = The Riffs led [us] through their compound where they were doing drills in the yard. The sight of a hundred people in karate outfits smashing ferociously at wooden dummies and breaking boards with their fists was all kinds of intimidating.\n\n
Malik was in a foul mood when [we] met with him. He folded his arms over his chest and glared silently at [us] over his shades. He seems to be waiting for [us] to explain [our] presence there.

factionMeet_judgment_happy_1 = [We] met Father O'Grady in his chapel study, behind a desk strewn with ammo clips and automatic weapons in various states of assembly. He was pouring over a well worn Bible bookmarked with hundreds of sticky notes.\n\n
What should [we] ask him about?
factionMeet_judgment_happy_2 = Father O'Grady was preaching to his congregation when [we] arrived. After half an hour of [a fire and brimstone-heavy sermon, punctuated by the occasional enthusiastic gunshot|a lecture on the evils liquor, followed up by passing around the sacramental wine|baptizing their new Harley in a bath of oil], he came down from his pulpit and greeted [us] warmly.
factionMeet_judgment_happy_3 = Father O'Grady was in a good mood when [we] stopped by today. Apparently his boys had [helped some sinners "see the light" in classically violent old-testament fashion|"convinced" a new group of survivors to join their cause, at gunpoint] earlier this morning.\n\n
Not needing all the gory details he seemed eager to share, I did my best to turn our conversation to business.
factionMeet_judgment_unhappy = Father O'Grady met [us] at the gates with a gruff handshake. He took [us] through their cathedral to look up at the giant crucifix at the end of the hall. He quoted:\n\n
"[The Lord said to His Son, _I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel._|_Behold, the Lord will come in fire And His chariots like the whirlwind, To render His anger with fury, And His rebuke with flames of fire. For the Lord will execute judgment by fire And by His sword on all flesh, And those slain by the Lord will be many._|_The Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus._]"\n\n
I'm not sure if it was a threat or a mission statement, but he's obviously in a real hellfire mood.

factionMeet_chosen_happy_1 = Cassandra welcomed [us] at the gates with an uncomfortably long hug. Their Church seemed to be in the midst of some celebration... like they always are. The cultists pranced around in billowy cotton robes, stringing daisies together and putting flower garlands on everything. Including me.\n\n
Do these people ever work?
factionMeet_chosen_happy_2 = Cassandra was all smiles when [we] stopped by today. She even invited [us] into her private office and served [us] some very flowery tea. [My teeth felt numb after drinking it|I thanked her, but said I didn't feel comfortable drinking anything that purple|The smell was a lot nicer than the taste].
factionMeet_chosen_happy_3 = [We] entered the Church of the Chosen Ones' main hall to the sound of chimes. Cassandra was conducting a small orchestra of fresh-faced young people, each holding their own small bell. They were playing a spirited rendition of "[I Just Died In Your Arms Tonight|Don’t Fear The Reaper|Only The Good Die Young|Another One Bites The Dust]".\n\n
Noticing [us], she told the group to take five, and came over to see what [we] wanted.
factionMeet_chosen_unhappy = The Church members seemed suspicious of me during the visit. A [young girl|teenage boy] eventually stepped forward and led [us] to the little house where Cassandra had her office. I could hear hurried preparations of some sort inside, but when Cassandra came to the door she slipped out and wouldn't let [us] peek in there.\n\n
"What is it?" she asked tersely.

factionMeet_pigfarmers_happy_1 = Farmer Bucket was in a jolly mood today when [we] met him at their fort. "Joinin' us for lunch [sonny]? We just slaughtered us a pig and cook's frying up some right juicy pork chops."\n\n
[We] politely accepted but only picked at [our] [p|meal|meals]. Something about all the large, sweaty men chowing down on bloody hunks of rare meat put me off.
factionMeet_pigfarmers_happy_2 = [We] found Farmer Bucket's boys, Jeb and Bub, taking turns throwing their big meaty fists into an old punching-bag which jiggled oddly with every hit and seemed to be leaking. I asked what they'd filled it with.\n\n
[Jeb|Bub] chuckled. "Heh heh. It's them leftover bones n' skin n' stuff from when pa's done cuttin' up the meat. Sos it feels like a real person when we hit it."\n\n
Feeling queasy, I asked them where their dad was. They pointed me to the back of the house where Bucket was just waking up from a nap in an old deck chair.
factionMeet_pigfarmers_happy_3 = [Our] knock at the Pig Farmers' old farm house was answered a bellow: "Come on in [p|friend|friends]!".\n\n
[We] found the Bucket family in their old 50's style kitchen, complete with a classic Kit-Cat Klock ticking away above the stove. Every counter, every chair, every inch of every surface was covered in a thick layer of yellow grease.\n\n
Farmer Bucket grinned and invited [us] to "sit down a spell" and "chew the fat" with him. [We] thanked him but opted to stand.
factionMeet_pigfarmers_unhappy = [We] had to wait while Farmer Bucket was out tending the livestock in one of the Pig Farmers' big barns. When he returned he was terse and angry, and his apron was wet with blood.\n\n
He eyed me meaningfully. "Had to put one of 'em down when it turned on me," he said, "Common problem these days."

factionMeet_luddies_happy_1 = "King" Owen Ludd greeted [us] at the gates and took [us] on a tour of their organic greenhouses. The English cucumbers, bell peppers and tomatillos made my mouth water. Less appetizing were the ponds filled with duckweed, which Ludd told [us] is quite nutritious and tastes kind of like spinach or watercress... and mud.\n\n
The other Luddies tipped their straw hats to us as we passed.
factionMeet_luddies_happy_2 = [We] found "King" Ludd [covering the roof of a farm-house with corrugated aluminum to "protect the children from malfunctioning satellite microwaves"|shoving a strand of barbed wire down one of their toilets to "protect against giant leeches"|smashing a pile of laptops with a sledgehammer to "remove the temptation of technology"].\n\n
[We] nodded and tried to avoid direct eye contact. Ludd's obviously having one of those days...
factionMeet_luddies_happy_3 = [We] found Owen Ludd [organizing an old-fashioned barn-raising|installing a new wheel on an ancient horse-drawn cart|fixing an industrial-sized wooden butter churn]. He beamed at [us] and asked if [we] wanted to help. I said sure - it seemed rude not to.\n\n
Two hours (and several strained muscles) later, [we] collapsed on his farm-house porch. Ludd fetched us some water with mint leaves and cucumber slices in it. Time for business.
factionMeet_luddies_unhappy = The Luddies directed [us] to a back field where Owen Ludd was working, saying "He's out there somewhere man, go find him yourself."\n\n
[We] did. He was in a corn field, all worked up and angry, spraying the plants with a pungent citronella mist and shouting "do you like that, huh, you ugly little aphids? Well don't mess with Ludd because there's more where that came from!"

factionMeet_stmichaels_happy_1 = Rufus bounded out of the school's front doors to meet [us], and slapped me lightly on the arm. "Tag!" He yelled "You're it!"\n\n
After a half hour of running around with the boys, they eventually let [us] stop and catch [our] breath. What did [we] come here for again?
factionMeet_stmichaels_happy_2 = Stepping through the doors of St Michael's School for Boys, I quickly had to duck under a [*stapler|lunch box|hockey puck] that flew through the air at head-height.\n\n
Rufus jogged up and apologized. Their game of indoor [*rollerball|dodge ball|Calvin ball] had gotten out of hand and turned into a minor war between the two teams. He took [us] to the old principal's office and promised the other kids would work it out themselves. Probably.
factionMeet_stmichaels_happy_3 = [We] found Rufus [*napping in a hammock, strung up in the rafters of the school's drama hall|sitting in one of the classrooms, flipping cards into a hat with remarkable accuracy|building a small fort out of school textbooks]. He bounded over and gave me a great big welcoming hug.\n\n
I put my hand out and demanded Rufus give back the [*harmonica|screw driver|notebook] that had _somehow_ jumped from my pocket into his. His grin just made me wonder what else he's stolen that I haven't noticed yet.
factionMeet_stmichaels_unhappy = [We] [were] stopped at the doors to St Michael's School for Boys by two fierce little warriors in private school jackets. A sign on the door read "No Adults Allowed."\n\n
I asked them if they were serious, but they just pointed solemnly to the sign. [We] eventually had to bribe the little twerps with [some stale mints|a can of warm Coke] before they'd let [us] in to see Rufus.

factionMeet_rotten_happy_1 = "Well howdy," Jesse greeted [us], "if it ain't my good friends come to visit old Jesse." He offered [us] a mostly empty bottle of Jack Daniels. "Care to wet your whistle before we get down to business?"\n\n
It was clear he'd been drinking all morning, but who could blame the guy in his state of undead decay. Probably lucky the stuff still works on him at all.
factionMeet_rotten_happy_2 = Jesse was up on a rooftop near the entrance to the Rotten's subway tunnels, whiling away the day by [shooting cans of tobacco off a chimney|cleaning his one remaining toenail|trying to fend off a turkey vulture that was stalking him]. He seemed grateful when [we] gave him an excuse to come down and have a chat.
factionMeet_rotten_happy_3 = [We] found Jesse down in the tunnels, [working on the sewer's rusted pumping system|fixing a dilapidated mechanical bull he'd scrounge from somewhere|surrounded by pieces of wooden Ikea furniture he was trying to put together]. He flashed [us] a gap-toothed grin as [we] walked through the door.\n\n
"This don't look like much right now, but that can be said for us Rotten. Some spit and polish and soon it'll be looking as good as new. So what can I do for you, [p|pardner|pardners]?"
factionMeet_rotten_unhappy = Jesse was in no mood for joking, which is saying a lot. He met [us] at the entrance to their subway station with four tough looking rotten, all of them wearing cowboy hats and chewing stems of grass, except the one woman who was missing part of her lower jaw. She just stared.\n\n
"Whaddya want," asked Jesse, "and this better be good."

factionMeet_government_happy_1 = Senator Davis was obviously going for an "oval office" look for her office. Everything was painted red, white and blue, plastered with American flags and the occasional bald eagle. But it was somehow serious and refined. She greeted [us] with a firm handshake, then we got down to business.
factionMeet_government_happy_2 = Senator Davis was overseeing a [parade march|uniform inspection] when [we] got to the Government's compound.\n\n
I'd have thought they'd drop all that pomp and ceremony, what with the undead hordes being a bigger priority here. But these sorts of things make Davis happy, and you don't argue with someone who has that many guns under her command.
factionMeet_government_happy_3 = The Senator must be looking forward to meeting with [us], because this time [we] only had to fill out the short version of their "[*Intent To Initiate Trade/Barter/Commerce|Non-Disclosure Agreement For Any And All Governmental Secrets/Communiques/Overheard Troop Gossip]" form. It only took half an hour to get through its [*three|six|ten] pages.
factionMeet_government_unhappy = A young soldier escorted [us] to a waiting room outside Senator Davis' office. [We] sat there for nearly two hours, flipping through ancient copies of The Economist and trying to remember a time when we had international politics.\n\n
When the senator could finally see [us], she was impatient. "I'm a busy woman," she said, "why are you here?"

factionMeet_dahlias_happy_1 = Nell was happy to show [us] around the place while we talked.\n\n
The Dahlias' compound had been a private gated community back before the outbreak. They didn't have to change much: just strengthened the walls a bit and replaced the tire shredders with a sturdy zombie-proof double gate. Today it still looks like an idyllic suburban neighborhood.\n\n
factionMeet_dahlias_happy_2 = [We] found Nell McClung sitting at a picnic table with a cup of tea in one hand and a pair of opera glasses in the other. She was watching her assistant Helen take a group of young women through [marksmanship|hand-to-hand combat|weapon maintenance] drills.\n\n
She set down the glasses and beckoned at [us] to join her. We watched one of the girls [take the head off a zombie mannequin at 100 paces|tangle her opponent in a series of arm locks designed to prevent getting bitten|rebuild and load a high powered sniper rifle in less than fifteen seconds].
factionMeet_dahlias_happy_3 = [Helen Vanderzalm, Nell's second in command|Amanda Klinger, the Dahlias' oddest-dressed soldier] met [us] at the gate to the Dahlias' heavily fortified community. She [sneered (her equivalent of a warm greeting) and ground out her cigarette in the dirt, then|waved enthusiastically, spiked shoulder pads bouncing, and demanded the newest gossip before] leading [us] to McClung's immaculately-decorated office.
factionMeet_dahlias_unhappy = Nell McClung wasn't eager to meet with [us] today. Her deputy Helen insisted on taking [our] weapons at the front gate and patted [us] down roughly to make sure [we] [weren't] hiding any more. Then they had [us] wait in the cavernous faux marble foyer of one of their McMansions while Nell dealt with an "urgent meeting".\n\n
Probably a lie... I could hear laughter coming from the other room.

factionMeet_leetcrew_happy_1 = Cryptico - uh, I mean Dara - buzzed [us] up to their apartment headquarters. Yes, buzzed. As in: they have electricity over there, and it's connected to intercoms at the gates which they can _open remotely_.\n\n
It's all very slick, but undermined by the fact that their HQ looks exactly like a college dorm. I'm used to some pretty bad odors, but I'm not sure some of these people have washed their clothes in years...
factionMeet_leetcrew_happy_2 = A thick haze blanketed the hallways of 1337cREw's apartment complex. I was confused at first, until [someone handed me a sensor vest and laser tag gun, and I found myself hiding behind cover beside Dara as light beams bounced around us|I found Dara in the 1337cREw's communal kitchen, standing over the smoking remains of a popcorn machine].\n\n
Dara smirked. "You picked a good time to show up. What's hopping?"
factionMeet_leetcrew_happy_3 = Dara was inspecting the 1337cREw's latest haul when [we] showed up. One of their scavenging parties found a flat of [Mountain Dew-flavored Doritos in the basement of an 8-12 Mart|high-end graphics cards, still wrapped in their static-proof packaging|vintage comic books from some long-dead geek's collection]. She was quietly opening one as I wandered up. "Sup with you?"
factionMeet_leetcrew_unhappy = The 1337cREw refused to let [us] in at first. They teased [us] through their gate intercom, saying "what's the paaaaswooord" in a sing-songy voice. I tried all the usuals: "please", "open sesame", "12345", "trustno1", etc. I found the answer by accident when some zed spotted [us] and came lurching over.\n\n
"Zombies!!" I yelled, and the gate finally slid open.

# Not sure if I'm getting the he/she right here, or if these will set off the gender parsing
factionMeet_pharmacists_happy_1 = Tiff and her husband Thirion were sitting on top of a wall smoking cigarettes when [we] reached their fort. Thirion gave me a hand up and offered a smoke. Tiff lazily surveyed the city.\n\n
"Business has been slow, " she said, "and the fish aren't biting. We're bored."\n\n
I think by "fish" she meant zombies? But I don't know how they could be bored. I haven't been bored in years. I'm too busy being attacked or worrying where my next meal will come from to ever be bored.
factionMeet_pharmacists_happy_2 = I found Tiff relaxing on a hill watching some [*purple|green|yellow] smoke drift lazily out of a nearby buildings.\n\n
"They're working on a new recipe in there," she told [us]. "It's so potent they're all wearing gas masks, and even out here if you breathe deep you're gonna feel it."\n\n
[We] sat as far up-wind as possible.
factionMeet_pharmacists_happy_3 = A gaunt, red-eyed [man|woman] was curled up in a pipe outside the Pharmacists' chemically-enriched farm. [He|She] hissed at me as I passed by.\n\n
When I mentioned [him|her] to Tiff, she just chuckled. "Oh that's just [Bill|Sal], don't worry about [him|her]. [He|She]'s one of our best customers. Wouldn't hurt a fly."
factionMeet_pharmacists_unhappy = Tiff and her husband Thirion were especially grumpy when [we] met with them today. Tiff kept snapping at her husband, then at [us], while Thirion slowly withdrew into a gloomy silence, wreathed in a shroud of cigarette smoke.


#factionMeet_outcome1BigSuccess = [FactionLeader] was blown away by my charm (and good looks!) [FactionHe] was hanging on my every word, laughing at all my jokes. I think we formed a deep bond today that I hope [factionHe] remembers for at least the next month.
#factionMeet_outcome1Success = I brought [FactionLeader] some little gifts that [factionHe] seemed to like. I mean, you can't have too many [glass elephant figurines|paperback copies of the Da Vinci Code|chattering wind-up teeth|toe-nail clippers], right?\n\n
#Anyway, it's the thought that counts.
#factionMeet_outcome1Fail_1 = [FactionLeader] wasn't impressed with my attempts to charm [factionHim]. I guess I laid it on pretty thick, admiring the decor of [factionHis] office, the way [factionHis] outfit matched the drapes and set off the color of [factionHis] eyes. Once I got going on this track it was kind of hard to stop myself.\n\n
#[Faction] kicked me out of there and asked us to please send someone else next time. Uh, sorry.
#factionMeet_outcome1Fail_2 = I must have said something wrong... after a few minutes [FactionLeader] suddenly stood up, thanked me for coming, and expressed hope that I wouldn't let the door hit me on the ass on my way out.


# declare alliance start
# {1} resource they will send us
factionAlliance = "An alliance..." [FactionLeader] mused. "Well, it is good to have friends. We could supply you with {1}, and support you if anyone else gives you trouble. But this is a big deal, and it needs a big ceremony."\n\n
To complete the alliance, we should address our people from our city hall, and formally announce our partnership with [faction].
factionAlliance_effect = Alliance mission available in city hall.
# replace if we already have an alliance mission potential or started
factionAllianceAlready = It looks like we're already in the middle of forming an alliance at our city hall. We should finish that first.
factionAllianceAlready_effect = Finish current alliance first
factionAllianceCityHall = "An alliance..." [FactionLeader] mused. "Well, it is good to have friends. We could supply you with {1}, and support you if anyone else gives you trouble. But this is a big deal, and it needs a big ceremony."\n\n
To complete the alliance, we should address our people from our city hall... unfortunately that means we need to build one first!
factionAllianceCityHall_effect = We need to build a city hall first

# finish declaring alliance quest mission
# {1} resource they will send us
# [name] = doesn't matter
# [name2] = main leader, who is also the reporter
factionAllianceFinished_title = Alliance with [faction] 
factionAllianceFinished_picture = cityHall 
factionAllianceFinished_pictureColin = [FactionLeader]
factionAllianceFinished_pictureColin2 = true
factionAllianceFinished = Everyone gathered at the city hall for the announcement. An alliance... we're going to share [CityName] with [faction]. For better or for worse, in sickness and in health etc. Peace, and a little support too. They've promised to send us regular shipments of {1} every week.\n\n
[FactionLeader] arrived with a small delegation and climbed the steps to meet us.
factionAllianceFinished_option1 = Announce the alliance
factionAllianceFinished_outcome1 = We shook hands. "Then we have a deal." [FactionLeader] and I shook hands." From now on, [faction] are behind you one hundred percent. If somebody messes with you, we'll be there to help."\n\n
[FactionHe] also agreed to start sending us regular shipments of {1}. We should expect the first one within a week.
factionAllianceFinished_effect = Alliance with [faction]
# use instead if we go to war or defeat them while finishing this mission
factionAllianceImpossible_title = Alliance Not Possible
factionAllianceImpossible_picture = cityHall 
factionAllianceImpossible_pictureColin = false 
factionAllianceImpossible = Nobody showed up for our alliance ceremony...

alliance_riffs = Malik bowed deeply to the crowd, then spread his arms and waited for silence. "For too long," he began, "we've been fighting over our little piece of turf. But it's all our turf, yours and mine. We'll keep it safe together. Can you dig it?"\n\n
"Yes!" the crowd shouted back.\n\n
"Can you dig it?" - "Yes!"\n\n
"Caaaan yooou dig iiiiiiit?"\n\n
We can. I grabbed Malik's hand and we raised our arms to the sky.
alliance_judgment = The old biker raised a Bible above his head as he addressed the crowd, like a preacher giving a sermon.\n\n
"All I know, " he said, "is you folks are as righteous as any I've met on God's green earth. You do unto others as you'd be done by them."\n\n
He led us in prayer, to give thanks for bringing us all together to save [CityName] as allies. When he said "amen", the other Last Judgement men fired their guns into the air and whooped. I guess that seals it.
alliance_chosen = Cassandra stared deep into my eyes and held both my hands in hers. It was very intimate, and a little weird. "Now we are one," she said, loud enough that everyone could hear, "and [CityName] belongs to both our people."\n\n
The other Church of the Chosen Ones members walked through the crowd, hanging garlands of flowers around people's necks. I gave a little speech, then Cassandra had everybody hug the person to their left. It was a very nice ceremony.
alliance_pigfarmers = Farmer Bucket had dressed up for the occasion, in an almost clean shirt and jeans. We shook hands firmly, then he pulled me into a hug and slapped a meaty hand on my back.\n\n
He spoke in my ear. "[Sonny], if we're gonna run [CityName] together, you and me, there's something you oughta know..."\n\n
He hesitated, then pulled away and laughed deeply. "Aw heck... you know, you know. Now let's get to the celebrating. My boys are itching to fire up that BBQ."\n\n
We filled our bellies with our new friends.
alliance_luddies = Two of the Luddies blew trumpets and a third cried "His Majesty King Owen Ludd the First!" as Owen climbed the steps with a sheepish smile. "The fanfare kind of started as a joke," he said, "but now it's one of our traditions. When I die they'll probably replace me with another King or Queen Ludd."\n\n
He flashed the crowd a peace sign and gave a short speech about the benefits of lasting peace and eating raw foods. He's right about the peace anyway.
alliance_stmichaels = Rufus gave me the old "up high, down low, too slow" high fives routine. I ruffled his hair in revenge and we play-fought for a bit. Then he cleared his throat and addressed the crowd.\n\n
"You guys are pretty cool... for adults I mean. Now that we're allies, you can come hang out with us any time you want."\n\n
I'd expected the day to end in some kind of giant food fight, but Rufus made an effort to get through the rest of the ceremony with a straight face. He's a good kid.
alliance_rotten = Jesse tipped his hat and gave me a "Howdy pardner", grinning his missing-toothed grin. The other Rotten stood to the side, avoiding our people as much as our people were avoiding them.\n\n
I asked Jesse if they were going to come out of the sewers and live in the city now, but he shook his head. "Every trail has it's puddles... but ours done got washed out in the flood."\n\n
The ceremony was brief. We politely welcomed our not-quite-human-anymore friends into the alliance.
alliance_government = Senator Davis was all business at the alliance ceremony. She gave a typical politician's speech: rousing, but full of rhetoric and contradictory promises of new jobs and lower taxes and better social services.\n\n
Then we signed a huge stack of papers detailing the terms of our alliance, in triplicate. They'll send us {1}, we'll support their military operations and share espionage intelligence. Not sure how much of this is actually relevant, but it's good to know they've got our back.
alliance_dahlias = Ms McClung clicked up the steps in her heels and we addressed the crowd, describing a future [CityName] run by us and the Dahlias together. We'll build walls so high that the world outside will be a distant memory, and children can grow up never knowing fear. To maintain the peace, level-headed women will run the government, and aggression and violence will be outlawed.\n\n
Not sure I agree with all of it, but the Dahlias sure do have this walled paradise planned out. It's good to know they're on our side.
alliance_leetcrew = Dara cruised in on a longboard and yelled "Hack the Planet!" in greeting. I _think_ she was being sarcastic, but it's hard to tell.\n\n
She gave an... interesting... speech. She said we were "twinked-out newbs" at first (an insult, I think), but we've proved our ability to "grind" and "score crits" (good things?), and this alliance is going to help "level up" [CityName].\n\n
She was being obtuse on purpose, but maybe just to be funny. Anyway, I agree: with their help, we're going to level this city up. Alliance FTW.
alliance_pharmacists = I wasn't sure how the Pharmacists would handle an alliance since they're self-proclaimed anarchists with no government to ally _with_, but I guess they figured something out.\n\n
Tiff just kind of smiled and waved at the crowd. I thought she might have been shy, but she explained that since the Pharmacists don't have a leader, it would send the wrong message for her to give speeches on their behalf. Instead we mingled and chatted about the future of [CityName] that we're going to build together.

# declare war
# {1} bribe they offer eg "10 food" or "15 medicine and a katana"
factionMeetWar_1 = [FactionLeader] was shocked when I slapped the glove down and declared us mortal enemies.\n\n
After a minute of thought, [factionHe] said carefully: "And what if we were to offer you {1}? Could we postpone this war for now?"
factionMeetWar_2 = I told [FactionLeader] that this city wasn't big enough for the two of us, and it was time for war. [FactionHe] mused over this. "But why come here to tell me?" he asked. "You know we'd never leave [CityName]. Why not just send your soldiers to tear down our walls if that's what you want?"\n\n
"Oh." he said a moment later. "Oh, I get it. How about we offer you something to change your mind... say {1}?"
factionMeetWar_option1 = Accept [factionHis] offer
factionMeetWar_option2 = Reject it
factionMeetWar_outcome1 = Hmm, that was nice. I guess we probably shouldn't try this too often, but if [faction] want to give us trinkets every now and then, I suppose we could be convinced to hold back on destroying them utterly.
factionMeetWar_outcome2 = I told [factionHim] I wasn't here to pressure [factionHim] into bribing us. I was here because war was coming, and the honorable thing to do was to announce it publicly.
factionMeetWarTooSoon = [FactionLeader] wasn't surprised this time. [FactionHe] just rose from [factionHis] chair and told me: "You asked for this."

# negotiate peace
# {1} price they want eg "10 food" or "20 food and a crowbar"
factionPeace = [FactionLeader] agreed to bury the hatchet between our two factions and declare peace, on one condition. We have to pay "reparations" for the damage we caused to them and their people: {1}\n\n
[FactionHe] insists it's just a formality so that everyone knows who was in the wrong here.
# price is higher because leaders aren't good enough
factionPeaceFail = After long hours of negotiation, our meeting devolved into a shouting match. I'm not totally sure how it happened but it's probably [our] fault.\n\n
[FactionLeader] says the only way there can be peace between us is if we straight up pay them {1}.\n\n
That's a pretty steep price for peace... someone with a little more diplomacy could probably negotiate [factionHim] down.
factionPeace_option1 = Pay for peace
factionPeace_option2 = Refuse
factionPeace_outcome1 = They've recalled all their raiders and attack squads, and hopefully even the secret saboteurs... though [FactionLeader] wouldn't admit they had any.
factionPeace_outcome2 = One minute we were disagreeing on some little piece of wording, the next [FactionLeader] accused us of sending saboteurs to attract zombies to a weak point in their walls.\n\n
Which doesn't sound like that bad an idea now that [factionHe] mentions it... especially seeing as they kicked me out and it looks like we're still at war.

# only possible if you start two missions at once
factionMeetTooSoon_title = Too soon to meet
factionMeetTooSoon_picture = [factionBackground]
factionMeetTooSoon_pictureColin = [factionLeader]
factionMeetTooSoon_1 = [FactionLeader] didn't have time to see me. I think [faction] might think we look a little desperate, since we were just here a few days ago... we should wait at least a week before trying to meet with them again.

######################################
# GREET ALLY
######################################
# Say hi to your ally

greetAlly_picture = [FactionBackground]
greetAlly_pictureColin = [FactionLeader]
greetAlly_1 = [FactionLeader] was happy to see us. [FactionHe] reminded me that they're sending us {1} regularly. Seemed businesslike about it, like [he] thinks we're only their allies because there's something in it for us.
greetAlly_2 = [FactionLeader] greeted me warmly. [FactionHe] seems to think our alliance is going very well.\n\n
I'm not totally sure what [Faction] get out of it, but so long as they keep sending us {1}, I'm not arguing!
greetAlly_3 = I checked in to see if [FactionLeader] had any odd jobs for us, but of course now that we're allied all [factionHe] requests is that we side with them if [CityName] ever breaks out into war.\n\n
Of course, we wouldn't turn on our allies like that. Especially since they're sending us valuable {1} every week.

######################################
# SCHMOOZE
######################################
# only set option1 and option2; the other two are always "Refuse" and "Come back later"
# title and picture are inherited from factionMeet
# may be 1 or more colins on the mission so use [We] [were] etc
# they all need a _return version for if you come back.

# result of the refuse option appended to every schmooze event
schmoozeRefuse_1 = [FactionLeader] seemed disappointed that we couldn't fulfill their request. [FactionHe]'ll probably punish us by having some new, even worse thing for us to do next week.
schmoozeRefuse_2 = I think [FactionLeader's] giving [us] the silent treatment like some kind of child. When I said we couldn't do it, [factionHe] just shrugged and went back to what [factionHe]'d been doing.\n\n
I said something like "So... see you next week?" but [factionHe] acted like I wasn't even there.
schmoozeRefuse_3 = [FactionLeader] was clearly frustrated by our refusal to help them. I tried to explain that we would if we had the resources, but [factionHe] didn't seem to believe me. I suppose we can come back next week and hope [factionHe] feels like talking to us again then.

# result of the come back later option appended to every schmooze event
#schmoozeComeBack_1 = We'll return when we can help [FactionLeader].
#schmoozeComeBack_2 = I told [FactionLeader] we'd be back soon.
#schmoozeComeBack_3 = [FactionLeader] asked [us] to hurry.

# They want 10 materials, can give them 5 instead
# remove any materials they have for trade
schmoozeMaterials = [Faction] need 10 loads of building materials. [FactionLeader] says they're to [shore up a weak wall|put a new roof on one of their houses|build a lookout tower on their eastern wall] but I don't think you'd even need half that many materials for such a project.\n\n
Not sure if [factionHe]'s lying, or their builders are just that inefficient...
schmoozeMaterials_return = [Faction] still want 10 materials for their construction project.
schmoozeMaterials_option1 = Okay, here are 10 materials
schmoozeMaterials_option2 = Offer 5 instead (lvl 5 leader)
# +5 respect, -10 materials
schmoozeMaterials_outcome1 = [FactionHe] seemed surprised that we actually gave them the full amount. "Um.. thank you." [factionHe] said. "We needed these quite badly."\n\n
The way [factionHe] almost laughed when [factionHe] said that, I have to wonder if they're just going to trade these to Gustav for smokes and brandy.
# +5 respect, -5 materials
schmoozeMaterials_outcome2 = [FactionHe] admitted we were right, that 5 loads should be enough for their needs right now. [FactionHe] said they could always use more though, so if we ever have extra materials in the future, their traders will give us a good deal for them.

# They want us to tell everyone how great they are; higher leaders can get more respect for it
schmoozeKissRing = [FactionLeader] is looking for a show of loyalty. In public, in front of the rest of the [factionNoThe], [factionHe] wants a simple gesture of fidelity from our faction to theirs. Not a big deal, [factionHe] insists, [factionHe] just wants to see [us] do it.
schmoozeKissRing_return = [FactionLeader's] waiting to see our gesture of fidelity.
schmoozeKissRing_option1 = Kiss [factionHis] ring (lvl 3 leader)
schmoozeKissRing_option2 = Give it some tongue (lvl 7 leader)
# +3 respect
schmoozeKissRing_outcome1 = [FactionHe] didn't literally have a ring. [We] just shook hands where everyone could see us and I spoke loudly about [how organized their defenses were|how lovely their clean streets were|their bountiful food supply].
# +6 respect
schmoozeKissRing_outcome2 = Eww, no, the ring was just a metaphor. What I actually did was give a rousing speech about the partnership between us and [faction]. I extolled the virtues of our benevolent friend [FactionLeader].\n\n
I went overboard and some of it might have been made up, but [FactionLeader] was moved by it.

# need to kill all the zombies on [square] beside their fort
# start a dangerous quest mission there
# exclamation mark will help players remember where it is, and prevent faction from taking that square
# option1 should be enabled if:
# you finished an instance of the quest mission sometime after receiving this schmooze request
# OR a square with an instance of the quest mission still on it now has zero zombies on it for any reason
schmoozeZombies = I asked [FactionLeader] if there was anything we could do for them. [FactionHe] told me they have a bit of a zombie problem in a [square] beside one of their walls. If we could solve it for them, [faction] would be most grateful. I'm not sure they care _how_ we do it, so long as those zed are killed.
schmoozeZombies_return = [FactionLeader] asked if we'd managed to kill those zed in the block beside their fort.
schmoozeZombies_option1 = Zed's dead baby
schmoozeZombies_option2 = Offer 5 ammo instead (lvl 9 leader)
# +5 respect
schmoozeZombies_outcome1 = [FactionHe] was impressed that we'd go out of our way to help them like that.\n\n
I told [factionHim] that the zombies endanger us all, no matter whose walls they're banging at.
# +5 respect -5 ammo
schmoozeZombies_outcome2 = [We] asked [factionHim] why we'd send our soldiers halfway across the city when [faction] could practically shoot the damn things from their own walls.\n\n
[FactionHe] seemed a little shamed by this but agreed that of course it made sense. [We] gave them some ammo so they could kill them safely from a distance.

# when finishing the schmoozeZombies quest mission
# [faction] = faction waiting for us to schmoozeZombies
schmoozeZombiesFinished_title = Zombies killed
schmoozeZombiesFinished_picture = zombiesDead
schmoozeZombiesFinished_pictureColin = false
schmoozeZombiesFinished = We finished those zed off just like the good little [factionAdjective] lackeys we are. Better head back to meet with [FactionLeader] and give [factionHim] the report.

# Like kiss ring but with a happiness cost, don't lose happiness if leader's high enough
# they must have strength >= 50 and respect < 85
schmoozeFealty = [FactionLeader] thinks it's time we swear loyalty to [faction]. I thought [factionHe] meant an alliance of equals, but what [factionHe]'s describing is more like submission to their rule.\n\n
This is awkward... some of our people definitely won't like this idea. Does [FactionLeader's] friendship mean this much to us?
schmoozeFealty_return = Are we ready to declare our allegiance to [faction]?
schmoozeFealty_option1 = Swear loyalty (lvl 2 leader)
schmoozeFealty_option2 = Use fancy language (lvl 8 leader)
# +5 respect, -5 fort happiness
schmoozeFealty_outcome1 = [We] got out there and declared ourselves to be loyal servants... um, I mean friends, of [faction].\n\n
Some of our people are upset, saying they didn't sign up for this when they joined and certainly wouldn't have agreed to it. But this is how politics go; sometimes you have to kowtow to the big boys whether you like it or not.
# +5 respect, no happiness minus
schmoozeFealty_outcome2 = I gave it the old "Yea, forsooth" and confused both sides into thinking I was agreeing with them. [Faction] thought I was praising their strength and benevolence, while our people heard it as ironic; actually a hidden statement of defiance against their bullying.\n\n
Hurrah for words! Good politicians can make them mean anything.

# they want 20 food but we can talk them down to 10
# remove any food they have for trade
# not luddies, rotten or pigfarmers
schmoozeFood = [We] asked [FactionLeader] what they needed, though I could already see it in [factionHis] eyes: they're hungry. [FactionHe] says that 20 days' rations could very well save some lives here.
schmoozeFood_return = [Faction] are still very hungry. Can we afford to feed them all?
schmoozeFood_option1 = Give 20 food
schmoozeFood_option2 = Give 10 food (lvl 5 leader)
# +5 respect
schmoozeFood_outcome1 = [FactionHis] eyes lit up and I thought I could see a bit of drool on the side of [factionHis] mouth at the thought of eating a proper meal. I hope they make this food last and don't just pig out on it.
# +5 respect
schmoozeFood_outcome2 = [FactionLeader] agreed that yes, we're probably right, [factionHe] doesn't really need to eat breakfast _every_ day. Maybe just on Sundays and special occasions.

# they ask you to go to war with FactionTypes.getHatedFactions[0]
# if that faction is not in fort.factions, try FactionTypes.getHatedFactions[1]
# do not start this event if hated faction is dead or already at war
# [faction] the faction you're meeting with
# {1} faction.type.lowercaseTheName they hate
schmoozeWar = We got to chatting about {1}. To say [faction] don't like them very much is a bit of an understatement. The two groups are in a kind of cold war, sending anonymous raiders to steal each other's supplies, and sabotaging their operations in the city.\n\n
[FactionLeader] has had enough, and thinks it's time to drive them out of [CityName]. [FactionLeader] wants us to go to war with {1}.
schmoozeWar_return = [FactionLeader] still wants us to go to war with {1}.
# enabled if hated faction is dead, or at war
schmoozeWar_option1 = Declare war on {1}
schmoozeWar_option2 = We need peace (lvl 8 leader)
# +10 respect
schmoozeWar_outcome1 = [FactionLeader] thought this was fantastic news; [factionHe] bubbled over like a popped bottle of champagne, pulling me to a map of the city so we could synchronize our military strategy and hit them where it hurts the most.
# replace if we killed the other faction already
schmoozeWar_outcome1Dead = [FactionLeader] thanked us for removing {1} from [CityName]. I'm not sure what [factionHe] ever had against them, but [factionHe]'s sure glad they're gone.
# +5 respect
schmoozeWar_outcome2 = We talked for a long time, trying to figure out why exactly [faction] and {1} can't get along in the same city. I felt like a psychiatrist, trying to find the root of the problem that must be deeper than a simple squabble over territory or resources.\n\n
In the end I convinced [factionHim] to give peace with {1} a chance.

# must have at least 1 trap or ResourceType.TRAP.canCreate true (skip check when returning)
# they want a lot of traps, can talk them down to 1
schmoozeTraps = [FactionLeader] wants to set up traps to catch zombies before they get too close to their fort. [FactionHe]'s heard we know how to build effective ones, and wants us to make some for them.\n\n
[FactionHe] asked us to bring 5 traps for them to install.
schmoozeTraps_return = [Faction] still want 5 zombie traps from us.
schmoozeTraps_option1 = Give them 5 traps
schmoozeTraps_option2 = Only 1 trap (lvl 3 leader)
# +5 respect, +5 strength, -5 traps
schmoozeTraps_outcome1 = [FactionLeader] must think we're real pushovers, giving them whatever they ask for like this and making them stronger. But we're doing it for us in the long run.
# +5 respect, -1 trap
schmoozeTraps_outcome2 = I tactfully explained that they could use one trap as a prototype to make their own, praising the intelligence of their engineers and implying they'd do a better job than ours anyway. [FactionHe] seemed pleased.

# don't need any bombs or the ability to create them
# if you give them any, they blow a bunch of buildings near their fort up
schmoozeBombs = [FactionLeader] has an urge for destruction. [FactionHe] keeps talking about the many uses of explosives and of all the problems that could be solved with a little TNT. If we could supply [faction] with a couple bombs, I think [factionHe]'d make good use of them.
schmoozeBombs_return = [FactionLeader] still wants to blow something up.
schmoozeBombs_option1 = Give [factionHim] 2 explosives
schmoozeBombs_option2 = Give [factionHim] 5 explosives
# +2 respect, +2 strength, -2 bombs, 2 buildings destroyed
schmoozeBombs_outcome1 = [FactionLeader] identified a few key "trouble spots" and blew them off the face of the earth.
# +5 respect, -5 strength, -5 bomb, 5 buildings destroyed
schmoozeBombs_outcome2 = Like a creeper in a glass castle, [FactionLeader] wrecked havoc on the buildings around their fort. It seemed to backfire a bit, as they lost some useful potential buildings and their contents in the process. This might have weakened [faction] in the long run, but at least [factionHe] had fun.

schmoozeRecruit_pictureColin1 = true
schmoozeRecruit_pictureColin2 = true
schmoozeRecruit = [Faction] are having a recruitment drive. Specifically, they're looking for {1}s to join them, and will treat them very well if they do. I can think of a few of our survivors who wouldn't mind joining [faction], or we could bring someone else. The question is, can we live without them if they leave?\n\n
Should we send someone to permanently live with [faction]? They'll be gone forever...
schmoozeRecruit_return = They still want to recruit {1}s. Should we send someone to permanently live with [faction]?
schmoozeRecruit_option1 = Give them [FormalName]
schmoozeRecruit_option2 = Give them [FormalName2]
# +5 respect, +5 strength, Name dies
schmoozeRecruit_outcome1_pictureColin1 = false
schmoozeRecruit_outcome1_pictureColin2 = false
schmoozeRecruit_outcome1 = To be honest, I'm not sure I'll miss [Name] all that much. I went to visit and make sure [he] was doing okay, and [he] kept saying how much better everything is in [faction's] fort. Way to rub it in...
# +5 respect, +5 strength, Name2 dies
schmoozeRecruit_outcome2_pictureColin1 = false
schmoozeRecruit_outcome2_pictureColin2 = false
schmoozeRecruit_outcome2 = To be honest, I'm not sure I'll miss [Name2] all that much. I went to visit and make sure [he2] was doing okay, and [he2] kept saying how much better everything is in [faction's] fort. Way to rub it in...


# they want you to set faction.type.getPolicyOption to true

# if starting again and policy is incorrect, replace with Angry text and -10 respect (only when starting, not returning)
# {1} policyType.name
# {2} policyOption.name
schmoozePolicy = [FactionLeader] wanted to talk about our policy on {1}. [FactionHe]'s concerned that we haven't considered the social ramifications of the way we're headed with it. In short, [factionHe] thinks we should change it to "{2}".\n\n
I'm not sure it's really any of [faction's] business...
schmoozePolicy_return = [FactionLeader] still wants us to set our policy on {1} to "{2}".
# replace if we've changed it back and -10 respect
schmoozePolicyAngry = [FactionLeader] is pretty angry with us. Some time ago we promised we'd change our policy on {1} to "{2}", but we've flip-flopped since then. [FactionHe] thinks we were lying about changing it before and is very disappointed in us.
schmoozePolicy_option1 = We have changed the policy
schmoozePolicy_option2 = Debate it (lvl 9 leader)
# +5 respect
schmoozePolicy_outcome1 = [FactionLeader] pretended that this had nothing to do with [factionHim]... the only reason [factionHe] wanted us to change our policy was because it would be better for us.\n\n
Yeah, right...
# no respect change
schmoozePolicy_outcome2 = After much convincing, we managed to come to a common ground on the issue of {1}, although I think [Faction] would have preferred if we just jumped through [factionHis] hoops instead.

# like policy, but reference one specific policy, faction.type.getPriorityOption
# only do if PolicyType.PRIORITY.isAvailable
# if starting again and policy is correct or we picked argue before, do not run again
# if starting again and policy is incorrect, replace with Angry text and -10 respect (only when starting, not returning)
# {1} their desired policyOption.name.toLowerCase eg "providing a religious moral center"
# {2} our current policyOption.name.toLowerCase eg "keeping people safe"
schmoozePriority = [FactionLeader] was in a philosophical mood. We walked around their grounds and discussed why we're rebuilding [CityName], and what the point of it all was. It seems we have differing opinions: our priority is "{2}", whereas [faction's] is "{1}".\n\n
[FactionHe] implied that we should change ours... but this is a pretty big deal, it might upset people to make such a fundamental policy change just because some other faction asked us to.
schmoozePriority_return = [FactionLeader] wants to know if we've decided to change our highest priority, so that our policy matches theirs: {1}.
schmoozePriorityAngry = [FactionLeader] is pretty angry with us. Some time ago we promised that our highest priority was changed to {1}, like theirs, but we've flip-flopped since then. [FactionHe] thinks we were lying about changing it before and is very disappointed in us.
schmoozePriority_option1 = Change our priority
schmoozePriority_option2 = Explain why we won't (lvl 8 leader)
# +5 respect, -5 happiness
schmoozePriority_outcome1 = Some of our survivors were disappointed when they found out we'd decided to focus on "{1}" just because [faction] asked us to.\n\n
It's a shame... I think they would've even agreed with it otherwise. At least [FactionLeader] is happy.
# no respect change
schmoozePriority_outcome2 = I explained to [FactionLeader] that even if our leaders shared [factionHis] ideals, we can't just shift our community's guiding principle like that. Especially not because some other faction thinks it's a good idea.\n\n
[FactionHe] just laughed and said it's too bad our leaders are at the mercy of democracy. I'm not sure if [factionHe] was kidding...

# if they are <= 60 strength and >= 70 respect they offer a tithe of 10/foodValue FactionType.allianceResource
# not government
# {1} "10 food" or "5 medicine"
schmoozeTithe = [FactionLeader] had a gift for us today. {1}. I asked what it was for, but [factionHe] just said they had too much and we could put it to good use.
schmoozeTithe_return = [FactionLeader] again offered us {1}. [FactionHe] wasn't sure why we didn't just take it before...
schmoozeTithe_option1 = Accept the gift
schmoozeTithe_option2 = Demand more (lvl 6 leader)
# +10/foodValue resourceType
schmoozeTithe_outcome1 = I thanked [factionHim] for it. I have a feeling there's more to this than [factionHe]'s letting on. Maybe [faction] are afraid we might attack them if they don't stay on our good side.
# +20/foodValue resourceType, -5 respect, -5 strength
schmoozeTithe_outcome2 = I pressured [factionHim] into doubling the amount, subtly implying that we could just come take it ourselves if [faction] didn't want to give it to us.\n\n
[FactionHe]'s obviously lost a little respect for us because of it, but hey, that extra {1} was worth it.

# misc quest mission like schmoozeZombies

# doesn't happen again after you take the guy (option2)
# option1 and option2 only available if you finished the quest
# [square] where the quest is

schmoozeRescue = A [factionAdjective] scout rushed in while we were speaking. In a hurried whisper, he reported that "it's happened again", this time at the [square].\n\n
[FactionLeader] sent him away. [FactionHe] explained that one of their scouts keeps getting into trouble and seems to be trapped at the [square].\n\n
[FactionHe] thinks this is an opportunity to prove ourselves and earn a reward. If we can rescue this guy, [faction] will give us 5 materials.
schmoozeRescue_return = [Faction] are still waiting for their missing man to return...
schmoozeRescue_option1 = We saved him
schmoozeRescue_option2 = We want him (lvl 7 leader)
# +5 respect, +5 materials
schmoozeRescue_outcome1 = [FactionLeader] was glad to see their missing scout back home again. [FactionHe] apologized for any trouble the guy had caused, and gave us the materials [factionHe]'d promised.
# +1 survivor, male scavenger with clumsy perk
schmoozeRescue_outcome2 = I convinced [FactionLeader] that if the guy was such a nuisance that they wouldn't even try to save him themselves, we'd take him off their hands.\n\n
[FactionHe] eventually agreed. [FactionHe] said the guy, [FormalName], was a klutz and always getting into trouble. Hopefully [he]'ll be safe with us.

# when finishing the schmoozeRescue quest mission
# [faction] = faction waiting for us to schmoozeRescue
# [Name] might get injured
schmoozeRescueFinished_title = Rescued survivor
schmoozeRescueFinished_picture = madman
schmoozeRescueFinished_pictureColin = false
schmoozeRescueFinished = It's worse than we'd expected... [faction's] missing scout has been captured by bandits. [We] listened in for long enough to learn they're holding him for ransom, and expect [faction] will pay "like they always do".\n\n
One of the bandits is teasing their prisoner with a gigantic knife, saying he's going to slice off a finger to send with the ransom note this time.
schmoozeRescueFinished_option1 = Attack the kidnappers (danger)
schmoozeRescueFinished_option2 = Pay the ransom (20 food)
# roll defense vs 15 to see if someone's injured
schmoozeRescueFinished_outcome1success = [We] rocked in there and killed the guy with the knife before the others could even reach for their weapons. The rest of the fight went just as well and [we] walked out of there without a scratch on [us].\n\n
The [factionAdjective] guy [we] rescued didn't know why this kept happening to him... but he was glad he still had all his fingers.
# [name] is injured
schmoozeRescueFinished_outcome1fail = [Our] attack did not go well. That crazy guy with the knife was faster than he looked. Sliced a chunk out of my thigh and damn near hit an artery.\n\n
At least [we] distracted them for long enough that the prisoner could escape. They ran off after him; I guess compared to that ransom, they didn't even think [we] [were] worth finishing off.\n\n
I guess we should check back with [faction] and see if the guy got away or not.
# -20 food
schmoozeRescueFinished_outcome2 = The bandits walked off chuckling and pawing through the sacks of food [we] gave them. Damn opportunists, probably not the last we'll see of them.\n\n
The prisoner couldn't explain why he keeps getting into trouble like this. He said he'd meet us back at the [factionAdjective] base.

# misc quest mission like schmoozeZombies

# option1 and option2 only available if you finished the quest

# [square] where the quest is
schmoozeBuild = Apparently [faction] are impressed by the architecture of our city hall. [FactionLeader] thinks it's amazing that you can't even tell it's cobbled together from scraps and bits of other buildings.\n\n
[FactionHe] wants our builders to make something for them. A {1}, which they want to put over a dilapidated old [square] in their fort. They'll supply the materials if we can supply the manpower.
schmoozeBuild_return = [FactionLeader] is still hoping we can build that {1}.
schmoozeBuild_option1 = We built [a] {1}
schmoozeBuild_option2 = Demand payment for work done (lvl 6 leader)
# +5 respect, +5 strength
schmoozeBuild_outcome1 = [FactionLeader] was impressed we finished it so quickly. [FactionLeader] wondered how much of the old building was still under there, and where we got the decorative moldings from, but I wouldn't tell. Trade secrets.
# +5 respect, +5 strength, +5 fuel
schmoozeBuild_outcome2 = [FactionLeader] thought we were a bit foolish to ask for payment _after_ finishing the work, but [we] convinced [factionHim] we deserved it.

# when finishing the schmoozeBuild quest mission

schmoozeBuildFinished = [We] did an alright job building this [square] for [faction]. I guess. Okay okay... I admit [we] didn't really put [our] [p|heart|hearts] into this one.\n\n
I mean, why are we building stuff for [faction] anyway? Whose idea was this?


# they want either one of two specific items
# {1} and {2} = EquipType.typeName of factionType.getFavItemTypes [0] and [1]
schmoozeItem = I asked [FactionLeader] if there was anything they need. [FactionHe] said [factionHe]'d kill for [a] {1}; their scavengers just couldn't find one anywhere. Or if we had [a] {2}, they can't get enough of those.
schmoozeItem_return = [FactionLeader] is still looking for [a] {1} or [a] {2}.
schmoozeItem_option1 = Give [factionHim] [a] {1}
schmoozeItem_option2 = Give [factionHim] [a] {2}
# +5 respect -item 1
schmoozeItem_outcome1 = [FactionHe] was grateful we'd had [a] {1} to spare. [FactionHe] joked that we can have it back when [factionHe]'s done with it, or [factionHe] dies, whichever came first.
# +5 respect, -item 2
schmoozeItem_outcome2 = [FactionHe] was grateful we'd had [a] {2} to spare. [FactionHe] joked that we can have it back when [factionHe]'s done with it, or [factionHe] dies, whichever came first.

schmoozeConference = [Faction] are hosting a city-wide conference to discuss matters of inter-faction relations and the future of [CityName].\n\n
Well that's how [FactionLeader] tried to explain it to me... but actually they just want us to go and nod our heads while they declare how they think things should be done. Who should we send?
schmoozeConference_return = [FactionLeader] is still waiting for us to choose a delegate to attend their "conference".
schmoozeConference_option1 = Assign [FormalName]

# option2 available if mission done and we have BUNKERS or TURRETS tech (can't tell what we actually built)
schmoozeTower = We got to discussing defenses, and I mentioned our engineers have plans for a nice tower that can be added to almost any structure. [FactionLeader] asked if we could build one at their [square].\n\n
It would really improve their defenses and general strength in combat... assuming that's something we want.
schmoozeTower_return = [FactionLeader] wants to know if we finished that tower yet.
schmoozeTower_option1 = We built a basic tower
schmoozeTower_option2 = We built a better tower
# +5 respect, +5 strength
schmoozeTower_outcome1 = [We] took [FactionLeader] up to see the new tower. From up there, you could see anything coming from four or five blocks away. [FactionHe] was impressed by our sturdy craftsmanship.
# +5 respect, +10 strength
schmoozeTower_outcome2 = All of [faction] were impressed by the new tower. It's a big improvement to their defenses.

# faction-specific schmooze events


# riffs want all your colins to know how to defend themselves, or half rounded down
schmoozeRiffsSoldiers = Malik took me to their training hall to watch men and women sparring and balancing in graceful crane stances. He gave a few pointers, then spoke to [us]:\n\n
"Every man, woman and child in our dojo knows how to fight. Each one is a soldier. Each can defend themselves if called to do so. I would like to see your people trained like this."\n\n
I guess he's saying all our people should have at least a little skill in defense.
schmoozeRiffsSoldiers_return = Malik still wants all our people to have at least a little skill in defense.
schmoozeRiffsSoldiers_option1 = All our survivors have lvl 1 defense
schmoozeRiffsSoldiers_option2 = Half are soldiers (lvl 5 leader)
# +5 respect
schmoozeRiffsSoldiers_outcome1 = Malik nodded solemnly. "Your people have an impressive devotion to the art of self-defense. I respect this."
# +5 respect
schmoozeRiffsSoldiers_outcome2 = [We] argued that it is more efficient to specialize. An engineer will be better at their job if they can focus on it without having to learn self-defense too.\n\n
Malik thought perhaps [we] [were] right, so long as we could guarantee there will always be a professional soldier around to protect that engineer.\n\n
We have plenty of those, so we should be alright.

# riffs want a level 10 soldier to meet with them to spar
# [Name] highest level soldier on the meet with mission
# reporter is main leader
# {1} perk name random from PerkTypes.SKILL_TYPES[Colin.SKILL_DEFENSE] that [Name] is eligible for
schmoozeRiffsSpar = "I am looking for a challenge." Malik told [us]. "A good fight. One-on-one, no weapons, no stakes but our pride. I want to meet your best warrior. If you are not [him], please bring them to me."
schmoozeRiffsSpar_return = Malik is waiting for our best warrior to challenge him to a match.
schmoozeRiffsSpar_option1 = Spar with Malik (lvl 10 solider)
schmoozeRiffsSpar_option2 = Throw down (lvl 15 solider)
# +5 respect, [Name] learns the perk
schmoozeRiffsSpar_outcome1 = Malik flipped [Name] onto [his] back so many times I think [he] forgot which way was up. But [he] was back up on [his] feet again every time, dodging and kicking in clumsy pseudo-karate style.\n\n
Malik won of course, but seemed happy that [Name] made him sweat for it. I think [Name] learned something too.
schmoozeRiffsSpar_outcome1_effect = Learned the {1} perk
# +5 respect, -5 strength, [Name] learns the perk, free EquipType.KS_NUNCHUKS
schmoozeRiffsSpar_outcome2 = We knew this was going to be a good fight when [Name] kicked the glasses off Malik's face and bloodied his lip.\n\n
Malik changed to a defensive stance after that, but it was clear [Name] had the advantage. After twenty minutes, Malik stepped out of the ring and bowed deeply, smiling through his bloody lip and black eye.\n\n
He gave [Name] a pair of nunchuks to thank [him] for the challenge. I think [Name] learned something too.
schmoozeRiffsSpar_outcome2_effect = Learned the {1} perk


# judgement wants us to have 10 churches, can argue we don't need any
# singleton
# option2 enabled if you have a level 8 leader on the mission, or someone with the preacher perk
schmoozeJudgmentChurches = O'Grady and I discussed churches. "The glory of the Lord cannot be contained in an apartment building or the back of an 8-12 mart." he said. "Our Father demands a suitably glorious place of worship. A church of soaring spires and inspiring artworks. Or perhaps five. Or ten."
schmoozeJudgmentChurches_return = Father O'Grady still wants us to have 10 churches.
schmoozeJudgmentChurches_option1 = We have 10 churches
schmoozeJudgmentChurches_option2 = 5 churches (lvl 8 leader or preacher)
# +5 respect
schmoozeJudgmentChurches_outcome1 = O'Grady was skeptical. "Those aren't non-denominational churches are they? I tell you, the Lord does not share His house with heathens."\n\n
[We] assured him that Sundays were strictly for Catholic mass. Well, except this week because the Seventh-day Adventists reserved it for their potluck.\n\n
O'Grady shook his head at our religious tolerance, but accepted that we were headed in the right direction at least.
# +5 respect
schmoozeJudgmentChurches_outcome2 = [We] convinced O'Grady that God is in our hearts, so we don't need stone buildings to hold him. Well, not as _many_ stone buildings.\n\n
He seemed to respect that.


# judgement wants 50% of our guys to be devout (rounded down), can argue no
# option2 enabled if you have a level 9 leader on the mission, or someone with the skeptic perk
schmoozeJudgmentDevout = As we spoke, O'Grady lapsed casually into quoting scripture:\n\n
"And Peter said to them, 'Repent and be baptized every one of you for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'"\n\n
"Acts 2:38" he said. "Do you know what it means?"\n\n
Apparently it means we need more converts. He thinks at least half our people should be devout churchgoers.
schmoozeJudgmentDevout_return = Father O'Grady still thinks at least half our survivors should be devout. We can't force them to convert, but I suppose we could encourage it by assigning them to missions with devout people. Assigning preachers to our churches should help too.
schmoozeJudgmentDevout_option1 = We have 50% devout
schmoozeJudgmentDevout_option2 = Debate (lvl 9 leader or skeptic)
# +5 respect
schmoozeJudgmentDevout_outcome1 = Father O'Grady nodded with respect at this news. He left [us] with a warning: "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned."
# +5 respect
schmoozeJudgmentDevout_outcome2 = [We] had a philosophical debate with O'Grady so intense that it made him even doubt his own faith. I kind of hated to do it to the guy, but he's wrong to believe so blindly without questioning some of the stuff written in that book of his. And he's double wrong to preach it to others instead of letting them come to their own conclusions.\n\n
In the end he admitted that at least we did know a lot about religion, and he respects that.


# chosen ones want 50% cultists (rounded down) 
schmoozeChosenCultists = "Clear your mind." Cassandra told me. "Make it completely empty of thought. Good. Now, imagine a world with no more stress, no confusion. A world where every being knows its purpose. You know yours. It is to spread... this message of peace."\n\n
"Not too bad, right?" she brought me back to the real world. "_This_ is the future the Chosen Ones are here to bring us. Have your people learned this message?"\n\n
She expects at least half of our survivors to be followers of their cult... I mean church.
schmoozeChosenCultists_return = The Church of the Chosen Ones would like our survivors to join their cult. We can't just force them to convert... but if we encourage their ceremonies and assign cultists to work beside non-cultists long enough, they may spread the message.
schmoozeChosenCultists_option1 = We have 50% cultists
schmoozeChosenCultists_option2 = 25% cultists (lvl 8 leader)
# +5 respect
schmoozeChosenCultists_outcome1 = Cassandra was pleased. "Of course, my children. And have each of you been in this month for one of our aura metering session? Regular metering is the only proven way to progress your aura forward to the next ring of awareness."\n\n
I told her mine would have to wait until my next visit.
# +5 respect
schmoozeChosenCultists_outcome2 = [We] told her we have many more followers at our fort, but they have already fully embraced the Chosen Ones and been converted. In short, they're zombies now.\n\n
She believed [us]. She asked a bunch of excited questions about the details of their "conversions". Rather morbid really, even though I was just making it up.

schmoozeChosen = "We are hosting our yearly Festival of Meats soon, to honor the Chosen Ones outside our walls." Cassandra told me.\n\n
"Would you like to attend? We only require one attractor device to perform the ceremony."
schmoozeChosen_return = "Will you be able to attend our Festival of Meats?" Cassandra wanted to know. "Do you have the attractor we spoke of before?"
schmoozeChosen_option1 = Attend (1 zombie attractor)
schmoozeChosen_option2 = Sabotage (1 attractor, lvl 5 leader)
# +5 respect, -1 attractor, [Name] gains cultist perk 
schmoozeChosen_outcome1 = The meats and attractor devices were lined up along the Church's walls. Undead wandered in during the day while we mingled and celebrated.\n\n
By evening there was a sea of them out there, pressing shoulder to shoulder, grasping for our offerings.\n\n
We lit candles and solemnly stood watch over the Chosen ones while Cassandra prayed for them. [FormalName] was entranced by the ceremony. I think we have a convert.
schmoozeChosen_outcome1_effect = Gained cultist perk
# +5 respect, -1 attractor, -5 strength
schmoozeChosen_outcome2 = It was... disgusting. They put attractors along the top of their wall, just out of reach of the zombies' grasping hands. Then we climbed up there and watched them while Cassandra prayed.\n\n
[We] pretended to be into it, but secretly sabotaged part of the wall so the attractors would fall off. I... I didn't know there would be people up there too. When the wall crumbled and that woman fell into the zombies...\n\n
The rest of them cheered. Like they were expecting it to happen. Like they were happy for her...

# pay food for a course with the chosen, creates a cultist
schmoozeCourse = Cassandra was in a rare salesman mood. "I believe you are due to take the next one of our Advanced Courses. Spiritual well-being is more important than anything. Personal belongings, resources, buildings, weapons, food, all are transitory and impermanent. Our Advanced Courses are infinitely valuable and trascend time itself."\n\n
"Only 10 food rations per level."
schmoozeCourse_return = Cassandra still wants us to pay 10 food to take a course on spirituality with them.
schmoozeCourse_option1 = Take the course (10 food)
schmoozeCourse_option2 = Ace the course (cultist, 10 food)
# +5 respect, +1 cultist, -10 food
schmoozeCourse_outcome1 = Cassandra attached a group of us to odd lie detector machines, then began the lecture. Cultists monitored the machines and took notes on our reactions.\n\n
"The Chosen Ones have auras like you and I, you know; it is what animates them once their hearts stop beating. We have metered them to prove it, just like we are metering you now."\n\n
"Now, imagine you are in a desert. There is a Chosen One nearby, but he has no legs. He is flailing, starving in the heat. Someone must help him..."
# +7 respect, +1 cultist, -10 food, gain INTENSE_FOCUS perk (ignore if already have it)
schmoozeCourse_outcome2 = They connected a group of us to the machines that monitor our auras, which look like voltmeters. Do auras have an electric current? I'll have to ask.\n\n
I was focused; my breathing controlled. I absorbed the course content with maximum efficiency, and their metering machines pronounced my aura to be nearly perfect.\n\n
Even Cassandra was impressed at the intensity of my concentration.

He says anybody will do and we can come back with them tomorrow. Their fort is safe with plenty of food, but we probably won't see our survivor again on account of the long hours they work.

Farmer Bucket gave us some pork chops to say thanks. He winked and said they might taste a little gamey on account of the natural diet they're fed.

He giggled at the thought. "Hah! Imagine me out there, going from town ta town... I got the beard for it I s'pose, but no [sir], I'd prefer ta stay here at my farm thank you very much."\n\n
I guess that means it's up to us to come to them. Farmer Bucket wants us to buy pork from them more regularly.
schmoozePigfarmersSell_return = Farmer Bucket still wants us to buy food from their traders.
schmoozePigfarmersSell_option1 = Their pork is the best!

schmoozeLuddiesFarms = "We were prepping for the apocalypse long before it happened, you know." said Ludd. "Had nearly 20 acres of farms all self-sufficient, and five year's supply of preserves in our cellars. Such a shame those raiders made off with most of it in the first year."\n\n
He'd like to see us build enough farms to survive on like they do, without needing to scavenge for packaged food in the city.
schmoozeLuddiesFarms_return = Ludd still wants us to build enough farms to be self-sufficient.
schmoozeLuddiesFarms_option1 = We have 20 farms
schmoozeLuddiesFarms_option2 = 10 is enough (lvl 7 leader)
# +5 respect, farms produce extra for a week (City.EFFECT_BONUS_FARMS)
schmoozeLuddiesFarms_outcome1 = Ludd was mightily impressed by our farms. He gave us some secret fertilizer to try out on them.\n\n
"Night soil"... some kind of dirt you have to collect at night or something? It sure stinks, but it works.
# +5 respect, farms produce extra for a week (City.EFFECT_BONUS_FARMS)
schmoozeLuddiesFarms_outcome2 = Ludd was skeptical. "You aren't using GM frankenfoods over there, are you? Pesticides? Then how do you grow so much in so little space?"\n\n
[We] told him the numbers don't lie... our fields are just more productive than theirs. He was impressed.\n\n
"Try some of this" he said, and sent [us] home with a heaping wheelbarrow of foul-smelling dirt. "Best all-natural fertilizer you can get. From me to you."

# luddies want us to have no labs

schmoozeLuddiesLab = "If we don't do something about this rampant technology," Ludd told [us] bitterly, "soon we'll be destroying the world all over again."\n\n
"Light pollution from searchlights, electric fences harming local wildlife. I thought we were past all this! The only thing to do is destroy all places of research. No more labs!"
schmoozeLuddiesLab_return = The Luddies still want us to destroy all our labs.
schmoozeLuddiesLab_option1 = We have no labs
schmoozeLuddiesLab_option2 = Technology is good (lvl 7 leader)
# +5 respect
schmoozeLuddiesLab_outcome1 = Ludd was happy to hear this. "Damn straight! Teach your engineers to scavenge, I'm sure they'll make great farmers. Everyone can farm, it's in our bones. Subsistence living is how society was meant to be."
# no respect change
schmoozeLuddiesLab_outcome2 = [We] debated with Ludd for hours on what turned out to be his favorite topic: the dangers of technology.\n\n
It eventually came down to [our] belief that theories should be tested, and his belief that science "didn't have all the answers" so it couldn't possibly disprove Ludd's theories.\n\n
We agreed to disagree. At least we both walked away from it without fighting.

I tried to ask what was wrong, maybe he's just cranky because he needs a nap? But he rounded on me. "I hope that's a joke [mister], cuz this isn't funny. Schools are prisons for children. You might not remember cuz you're like a million years old now, but they're bad places. Burn them all down."
schmoozeStmichaelsSchools_return = Rufus still wants us to "burn down all the schools". Except the one he lives in, I guess.
schmoozeStmichaelsSchools_option1 = We have no schools
schmoozeStmichaelsSchools_option2 = Debate (lvl 8 leader or scholar)
# +5 respect
schmoozeStmichaelsSchools_outcome1 = "Hahaha yeah, you know it!" Rufus kicked over a desk in triumph. "Screw school! Schools were just a way for parents to avoid taking real care of their kids."\n\n
"Also," he added, "screw parents."
# +5 respect
schmoozeStmichaelsSchools_outcome2 = I asked him why they all live in a school if he hates them so much.\n\n
"Well," he said, "the gym is great, and the shop and the science rooms have some pretty cool stuff in them I guess. Also it's crazy defensible cuz they totally built it like a prison."\n\n
I got him to admit that schools aren't all bad, so long as you have the right teachers.


# st michaels want us to be happy
schmoozeStmichaelsHappy = "Why are adults all such bummers?" Rufus asked [us]. "You guys are like, never happy. Cheer up! I want to see you having fun over there!"
schmoozeStmichaelsHappy_return = Rufus still thinks we're downers and wants to see us cheer up.
schmoozeStmichaelsHappy_option1 = We are happy (90% happy)
schmoozeStmichaelsHappy_option2 = Adults are never happy (lvl 6 leader)
# +5 respect
schmoozeStmichaelsHappy_outcome1 = "Then it's time for a _water fight_!" Rufus yelled and rolled behind a table, spraying [us] from a water gun he'd had behind his back.\n\n
I ducked for cover, then spotted a pile of water balloons in the corner. Grenades! I tossed a book at Rufus to distract him, then dove for the balloons.\n\n
We were all thoroughly soaked and smiling by the time we declared a truce. Nobody wins in war. Everybody wins in a water fight.
# +5 respect, -5 strength
schmoozeStmichaelsHappy_outcome2 = I explained to Rufus that this is totally normal. Adults aren't supposed to be happy. We know all about the world and all the good reasons there are to be sad. I gave him a few examples from my own experiences.\n\n
This really bummed Rufus out. He said he respects [us] for being honest with him though.

We spoke of their recent troubles with raiders and other groups. Sounds like most of them think of the Rotten as zombies... zombies with supplies they can steal.\n\n
Jesse asked if we could teach them to build better walls.

I cringed at the word "[p|citizen|citizens]" and the way she called it an "assignment", but obediently read through the form to see what they need.\n\n
Ammunition. Fifty packs of it, as quickly as we can produce it in a workshop. Wow... that's quite the requisition.
schmoozeGovernmentAmmo_return = The senator is still waiting for us to produce ammunition for them.
schmoozeGovernmentAmmo_option1 = Give 50 ammo

# +5 respect, +5 strength
schmoozeGovernmentAmmo_outcome1 = The senator didn't seem surprised at all that we'd actually delivered such an ungodly number of bullets for pretty much no reward at all. I suppose she thinks we're just doing our "civic duty" to the government.
# +5 respect
schmoozeGovernmentAmmo_outcome2 = [We] told the senator she could take half, or she could shove it.\n\n
Well... [we] [were] more diplomatic than that. [We] said it'd be better for [CityName] if our soldiers kept the rest and handled zombie defense at our end of town.\n\n
She read between the lines. We're being generous as it is, letting her pretend we did this out of civic duty rather than to avoid their bullying.

# government wants you to clear roads in a random square
# creates a dangerous mission on a random square
schmoozeGovernmentRoads = "I'm assigning you to Street Cleanup at the [square]" the senator told [us]. "We need all the cars towed out of the road there so our military vehicles can get through."\n\n
It's true, right now it's hard to get anything bigger than a bicycle through the streets without driving up on the sidewalk. But this is a boring, tedious job. It's insulting that she "assigned" it to us.
schmoozeGovernmentRoads_return = Senator Davis is waiting for us to finish clearing cars off the road.

"Is it in the report?" she asked. "Good. I'm sure one of our clerks will be delighted to read about it."
# no change, mission cancelled
schmoozeGovernmentRoads_outcome2 = [We] convinced the senator that one of their tanks could do a much more efficient job of clearing the street. If they can't push it out of the way, they can just flatten it and drive over.\n\n
I also hinted that we were not into taking cleanup jobs like this. If she wants to have us as allies, she better not try this again.

The failed exodus. Of course none of them would start, even the ones with the keys still in the ignition, so it took us the entire day to push or tow them away.\n\n
At least the zed weren't too bad; we took care of the ones who turned up to see what the ruckus was all about. We should include this in our full report to the Government.
schmoozeGovernmentRoadsFinished_2 = Seatbelts save lives. Most of the time. But from the carcasses buckled neatly into their seats all over town, I'm guessing seatbelts don't help when zombies are smashing in through your windshield to eat your face.\n\n
Some of the buckled bodies were now undead, but they were so snugly strapped in they could only wave their arms at us pathetically as we towed their cars out of the road. It'll be easier for the Government to get their vehicles through this part of town now.

schmoozeDahliasWomen_outcome2 = We had a deep discussion about the question of nature vs nurture, and whether gender stereotypes are hurting children so much as giving them a clear simple path to social acceptance and personal identity. Wear pink, play with dolls, done. You belong.\n\n
One thing we both agreed on: nobody should be prevented from doing what they want just because of their gender. We decided to leave it at that.

I was still confused, so she explained: we'll meet their people at [a] [square] and attack the zed there together. We should return after we've "killed the boss and collected the loot."

schmoozeLeetcrewRaidFinished = [We] met up with some of the 1337cREw at the [square]. Not Dara though... guess she had guild business to attend to.\n\n
The guys who did show were nervous and ill equipped, so it looks like [we're] going to be leading this one.\n\n

schmoozeLeetcrewRaidFinished_outcome1 = We pewpewed [our] way to victory from a safe distance. The 1337cREw guys mostly stood behind [us] and let [us] use up all [our] ammo. Typical.\n\n
At least we found some good stuff here. Better bring it back to the 1337cREw fort so we can divide it up properly.
# roll defense vs 15 to see if we succeed at melee
schmoozeLeetcrewRaidFinished_outcome2Success = Zed don't always die right away when you stab them in the head. Sometimes they lose control of the left side of their body, but not the right, or they go blind or start walking in circles. They're still dangerous, so you've got to stab, and retreat. Stab, and retreat. [We] got pretty good at it. \n\n
The 1337cREw guys were predictably useless, but at least they stayed out of [our] way and they helped carry the loot we scavenged. We should head back to their fort to divide it up.
# [Name] is injured
schmoozeLeetcrewRaidFinished_outcome2Fail = Melee is dangerous. [We] screwed up, or to be precise one of the 1337cREw newbs screwed up and I got tackled. No bites, thank the stars, but they had to take me out on a stretcher.\n\n
At least we cleared that place out and found some nice loot. We should head back to the 1337cREw next to divvy it up.
# -5 respect
schmoozeLeetcrewRaidFinished_outcome3 = One of the 1337cREw newbs got a little scorched when she got too close to our homemade firebombs. She's pretty angry, mostly because I won't stop laughing at her missing eyebrows.\n\n
We roasted all the zed. The smell was... well I don't think I'll want to eat again for awhile. But we killed them all, and scavenged everything we could find.\n\n
We should head back to Dara to divvy up the loot.

"I mean, I wouldn't want to pick up a gun without some. Normally I can't aim for crap, but on salts I'm a crack shot... And they make you feel so _good_."\n\n

"Now get out of here narc, you're harshing my buzz, as they say."

# pharmacists want us to celebrate anarchy
schmoozePharmacistsAnarchy = "I've told you a dozen times," Tiff said, "I don't lead the Pharmacists or control them. We're an organization of free people who answer to no one. I speak for us because I'm the only one who can stand this boring political schmoozing."\n\n
"You know what, I'd like to see your people try the same. For one day, how about casting off your opressive government and governing yourselves for a change?" she started to chant: "Anarchy! Anarchy!"
schmoozePharmacistsAnarchy_return = Tiff is still waiting on us to try out anarchy.
schmoozePharmacistsAnarchy_option1 = Anarchy! Anarchy!
schmoozePharmacistsAnarchy_option2 = We need rules (lvl 8 leader)
# +5 respect, starts EFFECT_RIOTING for 1 day
schmoozePharmacistsAnarchy_outcome1 = "Yay! Smash things! Nobody work!"\n\n
What, what? This wasn't what [we]'d intended, but as soon as we told our people we'd be anarchists for one day, they all stopped working.\n\n
I guess proper anarchy is more complicated than just having no government. How did Tiff convince [us] this was  a good idea?
# no respect change
schmoozePharmacistsAnarchy_outcome2 = "Ah alright you [p|wimp|wimps], you're no fun." Tiff pouted. "Though honestly your people probably couldn't handle it."\n\n
Here comes a lecture...\n\n
"Stable anarchism can't just happen overnight." she said. "People who are used to being led don't know what to do once the boss is gone... they gotta realize that being free means taking responsibility into your own hands. You gotta _become_ the boss. It's not as easy as it seems."\n\n
She seemed satisfied that [we] at least listened to her.

factionCultPreachDahlias = The Dahlias are particularly excited about this new religion worshipping the Chosen Ones. Their leader Nell has denounced it as a dangerous cult and banned it, but the other women formed a secret society in response. They get together at night to practice the required ceremonies in private.\n\n
They're eager to hear more, and each is looking forward to her own "initiation" into the ranks of the Chosen. They just can't wait to become zombies.

"Is it okay to kill a zombie in self-defense?" "What comes after Protocol Level X?" "Should I eat raw meat every day, or just on Sundays?"\n\n
I hope we can find - or make up - some answers for [him].

Indian sitar music was still playing from a speaker somewhere as [Name] investigated house after empty house. Then [he] found them.\n\n
Milling about in the community center, under a banner reading "We Welcome You Chosen Ones", were the Dahlias. All perfectly intact. All perfectly dead.
factionCultPreachDahliasEnd_option1 = Continue...
factionCultPreachDahliasEnd_outcome1 = Only Nell McClung was missing, but she'd never been into the cult. The rest of the women clearly had bought in completely, and performed a ritual to finally turn themselves into "Chosen Ones". Since none are bitten, we guess they must have injected themselves with zombie blood, or perhaps ate something infected.\n\n
But they're still zed now either way, and we need to dispose of them.
factionCultPreachDahliasEnd_outcome1_option1 = Shoot and burn them
factionCultPreachDahliasEnd_outcome1_option2 = Let them loose in their fort
# you get their fort and minus happiness from cultists
factionCultPreachDahliasEnd_outcome1_outcome1 = They were easy to pick off from the rafters above in the community hall, then we dragged them out back to a pyre. I doubt it's what they would have wanted, and members of the cult aren't pleased with our treatment of such recently initiated "Chosen Ones". But they need to see how pointless this mass suicide was, before it happens to us.\n\n
Now that the Dahlias have voluntarily vacated their fort (and their lives), we can integrate it to our own.
# zombies get their fort and plus happy from cultists
factionCultPreachDahliasEnd_outcome1_outcome2 = Our of respect for the Dahlias last wishes to join the ranks of the undead, we opened the doors and let them roam free in their old fort. It was very peaceful, watching from a distance as they staggered out to start their new lives as zombies. Free from the suffering of regret and the pain of past memories. Knowing only the pure fire of hunger, the single purpose of spreading their gospel.\n\n
There go God's chosen creatures, the dominant species of this new earth.

The [man2], [Name2], froze like a deer caught in the headlights. [Name] had to think quickly...
recruitInjurySingle_2 = [FormalName] found a very nice young [man2] named [Name2] living at that [square]. The poor [guy2] was so overjoyed just to see another human being that [he2] burst into tears at the sight of [Name] and agreed to join us on the spot.\n\n
[He2] wouldn't stop blubbering and shouting for joy, which is probably what attracted the zombies to them. As hands started bursting through the windows, [Name] only had seconds to act...

[Name2] could be a little more grateful, all things considered. [He2] won't stop complaining about is the loss of [his2] damn vase, apparently a family heirloom.
# half the time you both escape
recruitInjurySingle_outcome2success_1 = The recruit snapped back to [his2] senses and together they fought their way out of there. By the time they made it back to our fort they were exhausted, but couldn't stop laughing. What a lucky escape for both of them.
recruitInjurySingle_outcome2success_2 = The recruit had the same idea, and they managed to get jammed in the doorway as they both tried to shoulder their way through first. Such heroes.\n\n
Looks like they both made it back in one piece at least, and we've got a new survivor. Welcome, [Name2].
# half the time you're injured and recruit dies
recruitInjurySingle_outcome2fail_1 = [Name] booked it out of there as screams filled the room behind [him]. [He] fled blindly, stumbling down a staircase and twisting [his] ankle in the process.\n\n
But luckily the zed were far too busy with the recruit to notice. And hey, if the [guy2] was so useless in combat, it would only have been a matter of time until [he2]'d put us all in danger.\n\n
This was for the best.
recruitInjurySingle_outcome2fail_2 = [Name] led by example, hoping the recruit would find [his2] own way out of there. After a long wait, the [man2] came stumbling out of the building, clutching [his2] shoulder. [He2] was bitten...\n\n
They found a safe place to dress the wound and [Name] stayed with the [man2] for hours, chatting and telling [him2] stories. Finally, the [man2] said [he2] wanted to spend [his2] final hours alone, so [Name] left [him2] there.\n\n
[Name]'s pretty shaken up about it so [he]'2 taking a few days off.
# always okay but recruit dies
recruitInjurySingle_outcome3_1 = [Name] came back covered in blood - someone else's blood. [He] won't say any more about it but it's obvious [he] blames [himself] for the recruit's death.
recruitInjurySingle_outcome3_2 = Before [Name] could even try it, the [man2] jumped between [him] and the zed and yelled "Escape while you can! I'll hold them off!"\n\n
Unbelievable. [Name] feels terrible about the whole event. [He] returned to the [square] the next day and buried what he could find of the [man2]'s remains.

recruitInjury_title = Injury while recruiting
recruitInjury_picture = street
recruitInjury_pictureColin1 = true
recruitInjury_1 = The survivors camping in that [square] must have mistaken [FormalName] for a zombie when they started shooting at [him] today. [He] tried yelling at them to stop, that [he] was there to recruit them, but after [he] took one in the shoulder [he] decided it'd be better just to get the hell out of there.\n\n
[He]'ll be okay in a few days, but we should probably make that [square] a bit safer before we send [him] back.
recruitInjury_2 = [FormalName] didn't even make it to the [square] where we spotted those survivors. [He] was crossing through a parking lot when a grey pickup pulled up behind [him]. A stranger with a baseball bat stepped out, smiled, and thumped [Name] smack in the temple. Knocked [him] out cold. No idea why...\n\n
[Name] now has a terrible concussion. [He]'s asking us to make sure [he] doesn't sleep tonight, not one wink, even though I'm pretty sure that's just a myth.
recruitInjury_3 = [FormalName] was poking around that [square] looking for signs of the survivors we spotted earlier when [he] fell into one of their traps.\n\n
I'm sure it was designed to catch zed, not people; it was just a big pit hidden by a layer of cardboard boxes and leaves, and it wasn't even that deep. But [Name] landed funny and rolled [his] ankle.\n\n
After [he] eventually climbed out of there, [he] decided [he]'d had enough for one day and limped home.
recruitInjury_4 = A stray zombie caught [FormalName] while [he] was investigating a [square] for signs of survivors. It chased [him] all over the place until [he] finally lost it by crawling under a razor wire fence.\n\n
The creature got tangled quite pathetically in the stuff, trying to free one limb after another from the fence and slowly getting more stuck instead.\n\n
Unfortunately [Name] is pretty cut up too. That razor wire is some evil business.

Now as [he] approached the potential recruits [he]'d come to talk to, something just seemed off about the whole thing. They were tense. Even the air itself seemed tense.\n\n
We've adopted a policy to not blindly trust every stranger we meet, so [Name] now has a decision to make.
recruitDeathTrust = [FormalName] had a bad feeling about this recruitment mission the whole way there. It was just too dangerous, and [he] knew it when [he] agreed to go. Now as [he] approached the potential recruits [he]'d come to talk to, something just seemed off about the whole thing. They were tense. Even the air itself seemed tense.\n\n
But [he] had to trust these people, because that's what we do. We trust people.
recruitDeath_option1 = Approach them
recruitDeath_option2 = Run away
recruitDeath_option3 = Attack them
recruitDeath_outcome1_1 = Those bastards. They obviously wanted us to come to them, but it was a trap. [FormalName] walked over with open arms, shouting that it was safe to come out, that we were there to rescue them and they could come back with [him] and live safely behind our walls.\n\n
They answered with bullets. They killed [Name], then robbed [him]. We found no trace of the strangers, whoever they were.
recruitDeath_outcome1_2 = If only [FormalName] hadn't been so damn naive. Those people obviously didn't want to join us. They just wanted to know where our fort was so they could come rob us.\n\n
When [he] wouldn't tell them, they overpowered [him] and beat [him] to death.
recruitDeath_outcome2 = Bullets flew past [his] head as [Name] got the hell out of there. One of them hit [him] in the arm, but [he]'ll be fine after some bedrest. This was obviously some sort of trap, whether to rob [Name] or worse, we don't know. [He] escaped them alive, thank god.\n\n
Whoever those people were, they've left the [square]. Hopefully we won't run into them again.\n\n
Bummer that we didn't get any recruits out of the deal, but it could have been worse. [Name] is lucky to be alive.
recruitDeath_outcome3 = Ha! Not going to get the drop on us!\n\n
[Name] killed two of them before they even had a chance to react, and the rest scattered. [He] took what [he] could from the dead bodies, but oddly, they didn't seem very well armed for thieves. In fact...\n\n
Nah, let's not think too hard about this situation. Maybe they were going to jump [Name], or maybe not. What matters is [he]'s safe, and we chased the strangers off.

What should we tell [him] we want?
recruitConvince_NotUtopia = There's a [man] living at the [square] near us. [He]'s got a nice setup: a good cache of food and weapons, and traps to keep the zombies busy down on the street so [he] can pick them off one by one. [He] wants to know what's in it for [him] if [he] join us, and more specifically, what our ultimate goal is here in [CityName].\n\n
What do we tell [him] we want?
recruitConvince_NotNostalgia = [We] met a [guy] hiding out in a storage room in the [square] near us. [He] says [he]'s been on the move for years, always looking for someplace better. [He]'s not quite sure what that is but thinks our fort could be it. [His] one question is, what are our plan to improve things here in [CityName]?\n\n
So, what is our goal anyway?

recruitConvince_outcomeNotMilitary = "Nope nope nope," the [man] said, "I won't sign over my rights and freedoms to a bunch of meatheads with more guns than brains." [He] said [he] was happier out here where, sure, the zombies might eat you, but at least you could come and go as you please.
recruitConvince_outcomeNotUtopia = "Sounds like hippie hogwash to me."\n\n
It wasn't the response I was hoping for. The [man] seemed to think our plans were frivolous and had nothing to do with either survival or personal happiness. [He] accused us of wanting to take [his] stuff, like some "dirty commies".\n\n
I guess there's no place for this [guy] in our utopia. Good riddance.
recruitConvince_outcomeNotNostalgia = The [man] seemed unimpressed. "Yes but how will you stop this from all just happening again? We can't just wake up tomorrow and go back to our jobs like nothing happened. We need to make something _better_ than before. You haven't really thought this out have you?"\n\n
I agreed that maybe our fort wasn't the best fit for [him].

We might as well just put [him] out of [his] misery now. Then at least [his] body could keep the rest of us from starvation.\n\n
....\n\n
Yeah, we should eat [him], right?
cannibalRecruit_2 = The new survivor [we] recruited says [he]'s eager to help, but [he] isn't all that skilled, honestly. [He] could be a drain on our already dwindling food stocks, or could replenish them if we were to... eat [him] instead.\n\n
I know it sounds horrible, but we'd make it fast. [He] really doesn't know what [he]'s doing out here, and would probably be dead soon anyway if we hadn't found [him].
cannibalRecruit_3 = In the back of my head I was hoping there'd be trouble and the new recruit would come to the fort as a body we could use as food.\n\n
Well... I guess it's not too late. I haven't introduced [him] to everyone yet. Should we... kill and eat [him]?
cannibalRecruit_4 = We can't afford another mouth to feed! Seriously, we should have left [Name] where we found [him]. Of course, there is another alternative: like cattle, brought in from grazing.\n\n

We extended our food supplies by a few more precious days.
cannibalRecruit_outcome1_2 = [He] didn't know what hit [him]. Our zed killing skills work just as well on surprised humans. We'll eat well tonight.
cannibalRecruit_outcome1_3 = It was for the best. [He] didn't stand a chance out there in the city, and we just couldn't afford to feed [him]. This way is better for everyone.
cannibalRecruit_outcome1_4 = We got a gang together and did what had to be done. The recruit fought back, hard. I almost called it off when [he] started pleading for [his] life. I'm not used to that. Zombies never beg.
cannibalRecruit_outcome2_1 = Going hunting for human flesh wouldn't make us any different from the zombies. Besides, we need more strong backs like [Name's] to work our farms and scavenge for food in the city. If there's any food left out there to scavenge, anyway.
cannibalRecruit_outcome2_2 = We may be low on food, but the zombies are a more direct threat than starvation. Next time... might be different.
cannibalRecruit_outcome2_3 = Hahaha, what was I thinking? We're no murderers! Sometimes I get so hungry, you know, it's hard to think straight. Hope [Name] never finds out how close [he] came to being lunch.
cannibalRecruit_outcome2_4 = Sometimes I forget why we started this fort in the first place, but today wasn't one of those days. The new world we're making will have a place for everyone. Even if we starve, we will starve together.\n\n
Welcome on board [Name].
cannibalRecruit_outcome3_1 = I told [him] that on second thought, we really don't have the resources to let [him] join us. We gave [him] supper (in relative terms... it was [broth made from a McNoodles spice packet|more like a snack|just some leaves and tree bark that sort of taste like food|a thin stew made from the bones of the last guy we ate]) and sent [him] away.\n\n
[He] said [he]'d probably stick around, so if we'd ever like to have [him] for dinner again.
cannibalRecruit_outcome3_2 = [Name] was pretty upset that we changed our minds about letting [him] join us, but when [he] saw the state of our food supplies, [he] agreed it'd be best if [he] stayed out on [his] own for now.\n\n
[He] said we could drop by again if our circumstances ever change.

[He] was acting paranoid and defensive, waving a {1} in my face and asking rapid-fire questions: "who are you, who sent you, how'd you find me, what'd you want, are you here to steal my stuff?"\n\n
This is a delicate situation... how should [we] react?
recruitHostile_option1 = Try to grab the {1}
recruitHostile_option2 = Try to reason with [him]
recruitHostile_option3 = Talk [him] down (leader lvl 5)
# roll vs defense 12
recruitHostile_outcome1_success = I grabbed the weapon and twisted it out of [his] hands easily, then pointed the gun at [him]. After a long moment, I handed it back to [him]. Now we could talk like civilized people.\n\n
The [man] calmed down. It'd been a long time since [he] had contact with anyone who wasn't trying to rob [him]. I told [him] that wasn't a problem in our fort, and we had room for [him], especially if [he] knows how to use that {1}. [He] agreed to join us.
recruitHostile_outcome1_fail_pictureColin = false
recruitHostile_outcome1_fail = I feigned like I was going for some of [his] supplies, then grabbed the {1} and tried to twist it out of [his] grip. We struggled, evenly matched. Then the gun went off, blasting a fist-sized hole through the [man]'s eye. [He]'s dead.\n\n
I... I wasn't trying to steal it, I just wanted to disarm [him] so we could talk peacefully. But I guess there's no sense in leaving this useful weapon here. We're not thieves, it was just... an accident.
recruitHostile_outcome2 = I told [him] to calm down, but [he] was convinced [we] [were] only there to steal what meager belongings [he] had. When [we] backed away saying [we]'d come back later, the [man] lost it and started shooting over [our] [p|head|heads], yelling "Run away, you thief! Criminal! Spy!"\n\n
I suppose [we] could try again later...
recruitHostile_outcome3 = I kept my hands up where [he] could see them and spoke gently like you would to a child, saying I was a friend and I wasn't going to hurt [him], and that we had a nice safe place where [he] could come and live.\n\n
After a minute of this [he] pointed the gun to the floor. "Stop patronizing me, " [he] said, "I'm just cautious, not crazy."\n\n
[He] agreed to come check our fort out, and approved of our defenses. Welcome aboard, [FormalName].

recruitPicky = "So this fort of yours, does it have {1}?" asked [Name], the potential recruit I'd spent all morning trying to schmooze.\n\n
"And how about {2}?"\n\n
[He]'s full of questions, this one. You'd think anything would be better than the [*pathetic pile of mattresses|damp rooftop hovel|completely undefendable newspaper stand] [he] was living in now. But I guess these are valid concerns.
recruitPicky_option1 = Yes, it has both (truth)
# lowers initial happiness
recruitPicky_option2 = Lie (lvl 3 leader)
recruitPicky_option3 = Come back later
recruitPicky_outcome1 = Yes, of course, we're civilized people after all, and we couldn't call ourselves that if we didn't have {1} and {2}.\n\n
I didn't mention the host of other things we still don't have, like a swimming pool, skating rink, working telephones, or the internet, but [he] seemed satisfied enough. Welcome to paradise, [Name].
# lowers initial happiness
recruitPicky_outcome2 = [We] lied through [our] teeth, listing all sorts of amenities our fort still doesn't have. [Name] jumped up, packed up all [his] things, and moved in right away. It took [him] a couple days to realize [he]'d been had... but by then [he] was settled in and decided it wasn't so bad after all.\n\n
[He]'s pretty grumpy that [we] lied to [him], but [he]'ll get over it.
# we might have {2} so only mention {1}
recruitPicky_outcome3 = We'll come back later, maybe once we have {1}.

# single recruit lets you pick their skill
# [Name] = recruit
recruitSkill_title = Recruitment
recruitSkill_picture = street

recruitSkill_pictureColin2 = false
recruitSkill_1 = I recruited a [man] today named [FormalName]. [He] said [he]'d come from the south, that there was nothing out there for days, just ghost towns and dust. That kind of loneliness gets into your soul after awhile.\n\n
[He] said [he] was an odd-job kind of [guy] and could fit in wherever we need [him]. So what should [he] do?
recruitSkill_2 = The [man] I went to recruit at that [square] was so starved [his] skin was hanging off the bones. But [he] was chipper about it, cracking jokes about [his] recent diet and how Weight Watchers could've learned a few things from [him].\n\n
[His] name is [FormalName]. [He] doesn't have any special skills, but says [he]'s flexible, so what job should we have [him] do?
recruitSkill_option1 = Soldier
recruitSkill_option2 = Scavenger
recruitSkill_option3 = Builder
recruitSkill_option4 = Engineer
recruitSkill_outcome1 = We always need more soldiers, always. Might be because they keep dying out there...\n\n
Uh, I mean, welcome aboard [Name], now get out there and kill some zed!
recruitSkill_outcome2 = Scrounging, scouting, hunting, farming; scavengers are skilled at finding and making the most of supplies. I told [Name] it's not so much about good eyesight as being resourceful... though it does help if you can lift a heavy load. Scavengers do a lot of carrying.
recruitSkill_outcome3 = We need more strong sturdy walls and useful modern upgrades like zombie traps and watchtowers. We're rebuilding a city here, but it also needs to be a fortress. More builders like [Name] will help with that.
recruitSkill_outcome4 = Large construction projects like irrigation and zombie avoidance systems need more than just knowledge in a book; we need engineers with field experience to know how these things should be done.\n\n
We also need engineers to produce traps, explosives and other useful items in our workshops. These are in high demand from other factions, so producing these trade goods is a big step to rebooting [CityName's] economy.

recruitAwesome_pictureColin2 = false
recruitAwesome_1 = This recruit seems to think [he]'s something special, like something of an expert [job]. [He] says we're lucky we caught [him] now, before someone else snapped [him] up.\n\n
[He] says [he] won't come cheap though, that we should offer [him] something extra if [he] joins us.
recruitAwesome_2 = The last fort [FormalName] joined didn't end so well. [He] said they had plenty of food and a safe compound... but everyone was incompetent except for [him]. One night somebody forgot to close the inner gates, and [Name] had to single-handedly Rambo [his] way to safety through a sea of zombies. [He]'s also a professional [job]...\n\n
Okay, I get the point, [he]'s great. Now what can we offer [him]?
recruitAwesome_option1 = Offer Double Rations
recruitAwesome_option2 = Lie (lvl 3 leader)
recruitAwesome_option3 = Sweet talk [him] (lvl 9 leader)
recruitAwesome_option4 = Come back later
recruitAwesome_outcome1 = I told [him] [he] doesn't have to eat the second set of rations; food is actually the closest thing we have to a currency in [CityName] and you can get a surprising range of luxuries in exchange for it.\n\n
[He] seemed to dig that, and agreed to join us. [He] actually is quite a good [job] too, [he] wasn't lying about that.
# gains rebellious trait
recruitAwesome_outcome2 = [We] fed [Name] hot air about how [he] wouldn't have to do nightly guard duty like the rest of us, and how [he]'d get the best luxury mansion, with the best view, and so on. [He] was hooked.\n\n
It took [him] a day to realize [he]'d been lied to. [His] "mansion" was in an old water tower, the "view" was through a pair of binoculars, and [he] had to shout down if [he] spotted anything dangerous out there at night and... hey.\n\n
[He] hasn't left, but [he]'s a bit rebellious. Better watch out for that.
recruitAwesome_outcome3 = I flattered [him], admiring [his] skills and [his] strong sense of duty. [He] does have a strong sense of duty, right? Of course [he] does.\n\n
And someone so skilled and with such upstanding morals would surely want to help other people out of the goodness of [his] heart, wouldn't [he]?\n\n
Somehow this actually worked, and [he]'s excited to join us with no extra compensation. Sweet!
recruitAwesome_outcome4 = Hopefully there is a later, if this [guy] is as skilled and in-demand as [he] says [he] is.

They'd [*painted arrows for several blocks that led to the front door|spraypainted "WE'RE STILL ALIVE" across the door|covered the roof in flags made from colorful t-shirts]. [We] knocked and [were] greeted by a smiling couple.\n\n
"We'll just get our stuff, " they said, like they'd been expecting us. "And, oh yeah - you have room for three children too, right?"

Unfortunately, we don't even have room for both adults, just one of them.
recruitGoats_option1 = Of course, we love kids
recruitGoats_option2 = Just take one adult (leader 7)
recruitGoats_option3 = Come back later
recruitGoats_outcome1 = Three kids... I did the math... that's another ration and a half to feed them every day, plus two more for the parents. And we'll have to assign someone to watch their third child so these two can get some work done. I think we can manage that.\n\n
Welcome aboard [Name] and [FormalName2], and little {1}
recruitGoats_outcome2_pictureColin1 = true
recruitGoats_outcome2_pictureColin2 = false
recruitGoats_outcome2_1 = [We] made it clear that we couldn't feed so many children. I'd half expected the couple to slam the door in my face, but this started a heated argument between them. They weren't as happy together as they looked... in fact the [husband], [Name], was eager to go.\n\n
I kept my mouth diplomatically shut. After an hour of shouted accusations, the [husband2] tossed [us] out along with [his2] [husband], saying good riddance, that [he2] was taking the kids to join [faction].\n\n
That was... uncomfortable.
recruitGoats_outcome2_2 = Turns out the couple weren't married, and the [man], [Name], had only taken up with the others a week ago. [He] apologized to the [man2] and hugged each of the kids. [He] told them they should head to [faction], like they'd planned, and see if they have room for children over there.\n\n
I felt bad leaving the [man2] with all those kids. I hope they find someplace safe to live with enough food to support them.
recruitGoats_outcome3 = I told them we just can't afford to feed all of them right now, especially if three of those hungry mouths aren't old enough yet to farm or scavenge. They seemed to understand, and said they'd be waiting here if we change our minds.

recruitAnticannibals_2 = [We] met a couple very cautious {1} who are living at a nearby [square]. They spoke to [us] through a crack in the door, and kept asking funny questions about our food supply.\n\n
Specifically, they want to make sure we don't eat our dead. I'm not sure how to answer that...

recruitAnticannibals_outcome1 = I told them we've been lucky that it has never come to that. Our fort has a good source of food, and we've always made it through times of hunger with our morals intact.\n\n
They seemed satisfied with that, and agreed to join us.
recruitAnticannibals_outcome2 = They were happy to hear we were at odds with the Pig Farmers ourselves. They said they'd considered joining the farmers and had even toured their compound, but something about it had creeped them out.\n\n
"We wanted to see the pigs," [Name] told me, "but they wouldn't let us near the barn. Instead they kept asking if we wanted a tour of the slaughterhouse. Damn creepy people."\n\n
The {1} agreed to come back and join our fort. Welcome!
recruitAnticannibals_outcome3 = "Cannibals? We're nothing of the sort!" I lied. I told them I was a vegan myself, and can't even imagine the succulent, salty taste of meat on my tongue. And I certainly wouldn't think of committing such a blasphemous act of desecration on a human body, even if it was the last piece of sustenance on the entire earth.\n\n
I may have gone a bit overboard, but they bought it. Welcome [Name] and [Name2]. I hope we never have to eat you.
recruitAnticannibals_outcome4 = We'll come back and talk to these two later.

[Name] is very happy we were able to bring [his] friend. Welcome to you both.
recruitSickly_outcome2 = I'm not sure what's wrong with this [guy2], but [we] stuck [him2] with everything [we] could from one of our medkits. Real scientific-like. Looks like something in that concoction did the trick, and [his2] fever is starting to go down already.\n\n

"You're right." croaked a voice from the other room - the [man2] had heard us. "I can die alone just as well as with somebody watching. Take [him] with you."\n\n
That settled it. [Name] left food, water, and a loaded pistol by [his] friend's bedside. Then we left.

recruitFighting_outcome2_pictureColin2 = true
recruitFighting_outcome2 = [Name2] already had [his2] bags packed, and couldn't wait to be rid of [his2] roommate. "Good riddance!" [he2] shouted to [him] merrily as we left, "I hope you find someone who can tolerate you, you petty [bastard]!"\n\n
[Name] shouted back that [he] was done with [Name2] and this whole damn city. I'm guessing [he]'s not planning to stick around.
recruitFighting_outcome3 = It wasn't easy getting these two to sit down and talk to each other civilly, but there's too much at stake to lose it to some petty roommate disagreements.\n\n
We set some ground rules, and agreed that [Name] and [Name2] wouldn't have to live together or work together if it could be helped. In return they've both joined us. Hopefully we can keep them separated so they aren't at each other's throats all the time.

recruitBodyguard_outcome2 = Engineers are a rare breed these days, since it's one of those skills that isn't well suited for survival. All the engineers died, is the thing, unless they learned to scavenge and build defenses and use a gun. Or they hired someone to do those things for them, which I guess is the case here.
recruitBodyguard_outcome3 = [Name] was not amused when I told [him] [he] could either pick up a weapon and help defend our walls like everyone else, or stay here, huddled in this [square] until something kills [him].\n\n
Then I asked [his] bodyguard, [Name2], if [he2]'d like to join us and leave this [guy] behind. [He2] laughed and said yes, the job didn't pay well anyway.\n\n
[Name] finally threw [his] hands up in defeat. [He] agreed to try being a soldier. Hopefully [he]'ll like it.
recruitBodyguard_outcome4 = We've got time to think about this, and not a lot of need for leaders or engineers right now. Maybe someone could convince this guy to take up a more useful job.

They were packing their stuff, getting ready to join [faction]. Seems [we're] too late in more than one way. They asked why our fort would be any better to join.
recruitFaction_2 = I found a couple possible recruits and an orphaned child at the [square]. They say they've been watching our progress for a few weeks, but are trying to decide between joining us, or joining [faction].\n\n
Apparently they'd talked personally with [FactionLeader] and had a tour of their compound. What can we counter with?
recruitFaction_option1 = [Faction] are weak (25 strength)

They thought about this for awhile, then agreed that yes, our fort would be safer, especially for the little one. 
recruitFaction_outcome2 = I called in a favor from [FactionLeader], asking that we be allowed to take in these recruits. [FactionHe] didn't even seem to know who I was talking about, but said it was no problem.\n\n
The next day the three showed up at our gates. They said someone from [faction] had told them this was their new home.
# -5 respect
recruitFaction_outcome3 = [FactionLeader] doesn't care about [factionHis] people, I told them; [factionHe]'s just a glorified dictator, mad with power. And their military is such a joke, they care more about looting and raiding than keeping anyone safe.\n\n
I went on for awhile until they told me to stop, they'd heard enough and would join us. I sure hope [faction] never find out we've been badmouthing them like this...
# +5 respect, +5 strength

[He] and the [boy2] shared a long, meaningful look. I guess they've been through some hard time, and have trouble trusting people.
recruitFamily_2 = [FormalName] and [his] [son2] [Name2] seem to think they're better off on their own than joining some big organization like ours.

They've been all over this country, moving from city to city looking for some kind of civilization that isn't set to collapse at the slightest disagreement.

recruitFamily_outcome1 = For all their talk, these two didn't look well. [Name2] seemed half starved to death, in fact. I offered the [boy2] [an energy bar|an apple] and [he2] just about swallowed it whole. I told them there's more where that came from, and they practically followed me back to the fort like lost puppies.
# - happiness
recruitFamily_outcome2 = [We] listed off dangers [we]'d encountered: zombies, raiders, madmen, wild dogs, cannibals, slave traders... I eyed the [boy2] meaningfully. Yes, they even take children.\n\n
Then there's the various illnesses, starvation, hypothermia... hey, people may not be 100% safe with us, but their chances are a damn sight better than out on the road.\n\n
I think I scared some sense into them. They've agreed to come join us at least for awhile.
recruitFamily_outcome3 = I asked if they'd lost any loved ones in a fort like ours. "Yes..." the [father] said grudgingly, and began to tell their story.\n\n
They'd lived in a military-run encampment with the rest of their family. As usual it all fell apart... but it wasn't the zombies this time. It was people, trying to overthrow their leaders in a coup. Any innocents who got in the way were slaughtered.\n\n
Talking about it seemed to be cathartic for [him]. When we finished, they agreed to come back with [us].
recruitFamily_outcome4 = Sounds like they'll be here for awhile, so we can come back to talk again later.

recruitHidingFarm_pictureColin2 = false
recruitHidingFarm_1 = Turns out this [guy] [FormalName's] been hiding out on that farm for years, since long before we got here. [He] saw us move in but wasn't sure we could be trusted, so [he] stayed hidden.\n\n
[He] apologized for interrupting our reclaiming earlier. After we backed off and left [him] alone, [he] had time to mull it over.\n\n
[He]'s decided to join us.

missionFarmWinter_pictureColin1 = true
missionFarmWinter_1 = [Name] had to stop farming once the soil got too hard to work with. Guess we'll have to wait until spring for those farms to be useful again.
missionFarmWinter_2 = Since the frosts came, [Name] hasn't been able to grow much of anything on that farm. [He]'ll have to find something else to do until spring.
