# appears when starving or a food surplus
policy_rations_name = Rations
policy_rations_text = It's funny, I never really cared about food before the war. Sure I'd eat when I was hungry, but it just seemed like a necessity to living. These days I fantasize for hours about chocolate bars or roast beef, the kind crusted with herbs and spices and cooked slow for hours until it nearly falls apart on your fork.\n\n
It would sure make people happy to put together a decent meal once in a while, but I know we have to watch our supplies.\n\n
How much food should our survivors eat?
policy_rations_0 = Regular rations
policy_rations_1 = Decreased rations
policy_rations_2 = Increased rations
policy_rations_0_text = One ration per survivor, per day. The bare amount needed to stay strong.
policy_rations_1_text = 1000 calories a day? I've had milkshakes with more calories than that. We can technically survive on it our supplies will last twice as long, but people aren't going to be thrilled with the decision.
policy_rations_2_text = Save me some ding-dongs and caramel-corn, cause [daddy]'s hungry for snacks. I've lost 60lbs in the last two years you know; Lets see if we can put some of that fat back where it belongs.\n\n
Double rations won't just make people fat and happy of course. It'll give us more energy to run around fighting zombies all day, which is hard work. The terror and adrenaline alone burn like 200 calories an hour.
policy_rations_0_effect = Survivors each eat 1 food per day
policy_rations_1_effect = Survivors eat 25% less food per day and happiness decreases
policy_rations_2_effect = Survivors eat 25% more food per day and happiness increases

policy_ammo_name = Ammo use
policy_ammo_text = Every bullet counts now that they aren't making them anymore. We can save a lot of ammo if our soldiers close in on zombies before they start shooting. But I for one feel _way_ safer shooting those effers from the top of some building... even if I miss most of the time.\n\n
How much ammunition should we use?
policy_ammo_0 = Balanced ammo use
policy_ammo_1 = Spray and pray
policy_ammo_2 = Conserve ammo when possible
policy_ammo_0_text = We'll use ammo at a regular rate. Guns still aren't very useful if we ever run out...
policy_ammo_1_text = All guns will have increased defense and ammo will be used up faster. No sense in saving ammo when using it might save lives. Killing zombies from a distance is much safer... so long as we don't run out of bullets entirely.
policy_ammo_2_text = Zed are slow and predictable, so the best thing to do is let them amble right up to you before you shoot them cleanly once between the eyes. Or if you've really got the cojones, bash their heads in with a baseball bat. Just watch that you don't get any zombie blood in your eyes or mouth.\n\n
Guns will be less effective, but we'll conserve ammo for when we really need it.
policy_ammo_0_effect = No effect on danger or ammo usage
policy_ammo_1_effect = Survivors using guns gain extra offense, but ammo is used more quickly
policy_ammo_2_effect = Ammunition is used more slowly, but survivors with guns are less effective

policy_guard_name = Mandatory Guard Duty
policy_guard_text = Our permanently posted guards can't stay awake 24/7, so some of us have been taking turns watching the walls after dark while they rest. But not everybody. Others sleep peacefully through the night, snug in their beds, like the world isn't ending out there. Sure, not everyone's handy with a 12-gauge, but that's no reason to shirk duty, right?\n\n
Should nighttime guard duty be mandatory?
policy_guard_0 = Volunteer guards are enough
# decreases happiness in non-soldiers, increases fort safety
policy_guard_1 = Everyone must do guard duty
policy_guard_0_text = It sucks for those of us who have to do it, but there's no sense in forcing people to guard the walls if they aren't any good at it. They'll probably nod off or fire at a shadow and get the zed all riled up... right?
policy_guard_1_text = I spent the afternoon organizing a timetable for guard duty that gives everyone three shifts a week with a maximum of four hours per watch. I based it on the traditional two-section dogged watch of the British Royal Navy, adjusted to account for conflicting daytime duties. I think everyone will agree my schedule is fair and balanced, and quite the thing of beauty.\n\n
People are going to complain, especially those with no real skill at defense, but we'll be more secure with their eyes on watch.
policy_guard_0_effect = Regular defense and happiness
policy_guard_1_effect = Increased defense but decreased happiness for non-soldiers

policy_scavengerrisk_name = Scavenging risk
policy_scavengerrisk_text = We've all been there: you've ransacked a deserted house and already found more than you can carry. You're about to leave when you hear something bumping around in the garage. There could be anything in there: bicycles, chainsaws, maybe even a rifle. But is it worth the chance?\n\n
How much risk should our scavengers take?
policy_scavengerrisk_0 = Balance risk and reward
policy_scavengerrisk_1 = Get the easy stuff and get out
policy_scavengerrisk_2 = Scavenge everything
policy_scavengerrisk_0_text = It's worth a little extra danger if there's a chance of finding something useful. Our scavengers have to take chances every once in a while or could end up with no food or supplies; starving and defenseless.
policy_scavengerrisk_1_text = Our scavengers will be extra cautious and won't ever face off against a zombie if they can help it. Stuff is never worth a human life.
policy_scavengerrisk_2_text = We're going to have to kill every one of these zombies eventually, so there's no point in having our scavengers shy away from them. They'll take everything they can find, even if they have to take it off the corpse... of a corpse.
policy_scavengerrisk_0_effect = Regular scavenging danger and hauls
policy_scavengerrisk_1_effect = Reduced danger and find less stuff while scavenging
policy_scavengerrisk_2_effect = Find more stuff but take longer doing it

# only after running into it
policy_cannibalism_name = Cannibalism
policy_cannibalism_text = Food's increasingly scarce, but casualties are as high as ever. We're getting familiar with the feeling of real hunger: the cramping, the cold and listlessness. That feeling that you'd kill - I mean _kill_ - for a ham sandwich.\n\n
Every death is a tragedy, and not just because a friend is gone, but because by burying them we waste a precious source of food. I know some people don't want to hear this but...\n\n
Should we consider eating our dead?
policy_cannibalism_0 = Decide on a case-by-case basis
policy_cannibalism_1 = Reject cannibalism
policy_cannibalism_2 = Eat all dead bodies
policy_cannibalism_0_text = Yeah, let's put this decision off for now. I'm not keen to gnaw on some dude's butt until I absolutely have to.
policy_cannibalism_1_text = Of course, of course, what was I thinking! I'd never even _dream_ of eating our comrades. No sir, last night I was dreaming of eating roast pork. That was definitely pork in my dream, not my friend [Name2].
policy_cannibalism_2_text = This was a hard decision, but if it's me who dies next, I want my body to be of use to my friends.\n\n
First, we draw straws for who chops 'em up. The hands, feet, head and innards get a proper burial since they're too... recognizable. We roast the rest until the meat falls off the bones then make a stew out of it with whatever else we can scrape together. I gagged the first time I tried our "[CityName] stew", but the truth is it's delicious. People are delicious.
policy_cannibalism_0_effect = Ask every time someone dies
policy_cannibalism_1_effect = Ban eating the dead, may upset some factions
policy_cannibalism_2_effect = Automatically increases food when someone dies

# after meeting the church and having at least 1 cultist
policy_chosen_name = Books from the Chosen Ones
policy_chosen_text = Hand-printed pamphlets have been showing up with titles like "The Spiritual Zombie" and "The Zed in Each of Us". They seem to be propaganda from the Church of the Chosen Ones. They call the virus a gift, and say we should respect and even worship the zombies.\n\n
People seem to like these ideas, because it suggests the disease - all this death, everything - might serve a higher purpose. But this cult could be dangerous. Should our survivors be allowed to read this stuff?
policy_chosen_0 = Allow Chosen Ones literature
policy_chosen_1 = Ban cult books and literature
policy_chosen_0_text = We believe in freedom of speech and freedom of thought. We can't start censoring ideas just because they're a little controversial. Who knows, these guys might even be right. From the way I see it, the zombies _are_ better equipped to survive than us humans. Maybe we're the dinosaurs, here.
policy_chosen_1_text = I feel bad censoring something that makes our people happy, but this "church" and its ideas are dangerous. We need to stop it from spreading before it's too late.
policy_chosen_0_effect = Allows the spread of the Cultist trait
policy_chosen_1_effect = Will anger the Church of the Chosen Ones faction

# equipment may be auto-equipped, possibly causing anger to lower-level survivors
policy_autoequip_name = Assigning equipment
policy_autoequip_text = I'm sick of everyone coming to me when there's a new gun or tool to be handed out. We should define a fort-wide policy for this. The problem is, who gets the good stuff?\n\n
When we find new equipment, should we automatically assign it to survivors?
policy_autoequip_0 = Manually equip items
policy_autoequip_1 = Equip skilled survivors first
policy_autoequip_2 = Equip people at random
policy_autoequip_0_text = New equipment will be put into storage as usual.
policy_autoequip_1_text = It makes sense to have a few well-equipped people to do the important work around here, so the best builders will get the best tools, and the best soldiers will get the best guns.\n\n
People are going to complain, but I'll tell the whiners to go do target practice with a pea shooter until they're good enough for a real weapon.
policy_autoequip_2_text = Anybody who doesn't have a decent weapon or tool can draw lots for whatever our scavengers find. It wouldn't be fair to give the best guns to the best soldiers when having one is a matter of life or death. Maybe the best marksmen are only skilled because they had good weapons to practice with.
policy_autoequip_0_effect = Equipment will not be automatically equipped
policy_autoequip_1_effect = New equipment is optimally distributed, causes unhappiness
policy_autoequip_2_effect = New equipment randomly assigned to anyone who doesn't have one

# after first pregnancy
policy_babies_name = Having babies
policy_babies_text = The repopulation of the earth... is it time to talk about this already? I mean, we're going to have to start thinking about the next generation at some point, but are we ready for it?\n\n
Can we really protect the children we bring into this world? And if we don't have children, what's the point of continuing on?\n\n
Should we let survivors have children?
policy_babies_0 = None of our business
policy_babies_1 = Encourage couples to start families
policy_babies_2 = We aren't ready for children
policy_babies_0_text = People still have a right to make this kind of decision themselves without pressure from the community.
policy_babies_1_text = Survival doesn't just mean staying alive. We lost a lot of children when hell broke loose, and without kids we don't have much to live for. We need to think of the future, starting now.\n\n
I'm not saying we'll take people's condoms away or turn women into cattle, but if a couple is the right age we'll let them know that their duty to our community includes raising the next generation.
policy_babies_2_text = Babies? During the apocalypse? We hardly know if we'll be able to feed ourselves from one month to the next; how the hell are we supposed to take care of a child? It would be cruel to bring a baby into a world like this, and a burden on the whole community.\n\n
If anyone in [CityName] is looking to get started on the next generation, we'll let them know this is not the time or place for it. I'm not saying we'll force a pregnant woman into anything she doesn't want, but we'll make sure she has options.
policy_babies_0_effect = Regular chance for children
policy_babies_1_effect = Children are more likely
policy_babies_2_effect = Children are less likely, some people may become unhappy

# only after meeting misogynists or women factions
policy_women_name = Gender roles
policy_women_text = Some folks feel that our women should be shielded from the horrors of the fight against the undead. That way they can focus on supporting our families and keep the fort running smoothly from the inside.\n\n
Others think women are just as fit to carry guns and blow the faces off things, and hint that men should do more of the cooking and cleaning around here.\n\n
What is a woman's role in our new world?
policy_women_0 = People can do what they want
policy_women_1 = Everyone does chores and guard duty
policy_women_2 = Women should stay safe at home
policy_women_0_text = A woman's role is whatever she wants it to be.
policy_women_1_text = If this apocalypse has taught us anything, it's that people are capable of more than they ever realized. We have a chance here to shrug off ten thousand years of socially-imposed gender roles and let people be who they really are regardless of gender, race or wealth.\n\n
Plus let's be honest, _nobody_ wants to do those dishes.
policy_women_2_text = In times of strife people are comforted by the familiar. Give them a reliable schedule, diversions from their old lives, and a sense of normalcy. Teaching women to shoot zombies or men to mend clothes is just going to stress everybody out, when what we should be doing is getting things back to the way they were, as much as that's possible.\n\n
We'll still be able to assign women to leave the fort, but they won't join in guard duty at night.
policy_women_0_effect = No change in happiness
policy_women_1_effect = Devout unhappy, women gain defense, angers some factions
policy_women_2_effect = Devout happy, women lose defense, angers some factions

# need a church and a bar
policy_churches_name = Churches vs bars
policy_churches_text = We've got a little food and supplies saved up for a rainy day, you could call it our "entertainment budget". We could either use it to spice up Sunday sermons, or throw a damn good party at the bar every now and again.\n\n
What should we spend it on?
policy_churches_0 = Finance churches and bars evenly
policy_churches_1 = Give more to churches
policy_churches_2 = Give more to bars
policy_churches_0_text = The only fair thing would be to split it evenly between churches and bars.
policy_churches_1_text = We shouldn't encourage people to drink, and let's face it: what the hell do we have to celebrate anyway? What people need is an explanation for all this madness, and the only place they're going to find that is at church.
policy_churches_2_text = What's the point of going to church; so they can remind me of what I did to end up in this hell? Much better to lighten the mood around here with a little celebration at the old Crow & Gate. I think [Name2's] birthday is coming up next week.
policy_churches_0_effect = No change in happiness
policy_churches_1_effect = Doubles happiness effects of churches and preaching, halves bars
policy_churches_2_effect = Doubles happiness effects of bars and bartending, halves churches

# people may pick random law decisions
policy_vote_name = Rock the vote
policy_vote_text = There are still tough decisions in [CityName's] future, and people's lives may depend on the outcomes. Not everyone's cut out to have that kind of weight on their shoulders... and quite frankly, some fail to see the big picture and consider the greater good.\n\n
Having one leader call all the shots will make it easier to get things done, but so much power can corrupt a person. Our people would rather we elect a senate to do the voting, but they may be prone to infighting. So, who should vote?
policy_vote_0 = Leader chooses policies
policy_vote_1 = Leader and senate pick policies
policy_vote_2 = All survivors vote on policies
policy_vote_0_text = No offense to them, but some of the people around here wouldn't be voting with their heads. They just don't have all the facts like I do, and couldn't live with the hard decisions that I have to make sometimes.\n\n
Some people may not ever understand this, but I'm doing it for them.
policy_vote_1_text = The sweet spot between too much democracy and not enough. We'll vote for a couple people to be our senate, and they'll help keep me honest. Hopefully we won't see any fillibusters or other chicanery around here.
policy_vote_2_text = The only right way to decide things is to do it democratically. From now we're going to vote on any new policies that come up. I'll still make decisions for smaller day to day things, but everyone should have a say for rules that affect the whole fort.\n\n
This should make everyone happy... though it may take a few weeks for people to appreciate the democratic process.
policy_vote_0_effect = Regular policy system
policy_vote_1_effect = Occasional government conflicts, happiness increases
policy_vote_2_effect = Random policies will be chosen, happiness increases

policy_strangers_name = Stranger Danger
policy_strangers_text = We're not the only living people left in this city, but there's no telling how people we meet out there are going to treat our scavengers and soldiers. Sometimes they greet us with shouts of joy, sometimes with warning shots. Sometimes it might be best to shoot first. \n\n
So how should we approach strangers?
policy_strangers_0 = With open arms
# fewer random recruitments and less chance of survivors getting shot
policy_strangers_1 = With caution
# changes faction standings
policy_strangers_2 = With hostility
policy_strangers_0_text = The people out there are the same decent folk they were before the world went to hell. Some of them are scared, or desperate, but if we approach them openly and honestly it's likely they'll do the same.
policy_strangers_1_text = I've met people in the last two years who would just as soon kill me and take my stuff as have a conversation. But I've also had my life saved by a total stranger. We should size new people up cautiously before we invite them into the fort.
policy_strangers_2_text = As far as I can tell, we are the last bastion of civilization on this godforsaken earth. There are no innocents left, and anyone out wandering the city by themselves probably got kicked out of their last group for some good reason.\n\n
We approach survivors with weapons drawn, and trust no one till they've earned that trust. Other factions may not appreciate this attitude.
policy_strangers_0_effect = Regular danger and success chance for recruitment missions
policy_strangers_1_effect = Recruitment is less dangerous and less likely to succeed
policy_strangers_2_effect = Recruitment is less dangerous and less likely to succeed

# only after generators are researched
policy_power_name = Generators
policy_power_text = We've got electricity now but it takes fuel to run those generators. It's no picnic siphoning diesel from a truck while zed shuffle down the next block, and someday all those gas tanks are going to run dry.\n\n
How often should we run the generators?
policy_power_0 = Never run the generators
policy_power_1 = Run them in the morning & evening
policy_power_2 = Run generators all the time
policy_power_0_text = We're saving all our fuel for when we really need it. In the meantime we've got candles and batteries, and when those are gone, good old-fashioned moonlight.
policy_power_1_text = People will be happy they've got power and light for a few hours every day. Not enough for aircon, dryers or ovens of course, but we can at least make coffee and toast... if we had something to toast.
policy_power_2_text = Lights! Music! Video Games! A cool fan on a hot day. Maybe even that hydro-therapy foot massager I found in the Allmart. Aaaah, that feels good.
policy_power_0_effect = No happiness change
policy_power_1_effect = Increased happiness at cost of 1 fuel/week
policy_power_2_effect = Increased happiness at cost of 2 fuel/week

# only after meeting pharmacists
policy_drugs_name = Bath salts
policy_drugs_text = Some of the Pharmacists keep trying to sell us this new drug they call _"bath_salts"_. It's some kind of crystal you eat or shove up your nose or something, and I hear it makes you feel strong and fearless.\n\n
Not being terrified? That'd be nice for a change, but the stuff's addictive and nothing comes without a price.\n\n
Should we ban bath salts?
# ODs or addicts who won't work, pharmacists like us more
policy_drugs_0 = Allow bath salts
policy_drugs_1 = Ban bath salts
policy_drugs_0_text = At worst, bath salts are a recreational drug you can get hooked on - just like alcohol or cigarettes. At best they might help our soldiers be more effective zombie-killers, or help people recover from post-traumatic stress.\n\n
We'll allow this new drug but keep our eyes out for people overdoing it.
policy_drugs_1_text = We're banning _bath_salts_. Drugs like this were the worst part of our former society. They make people feel so good that regular old I'm-happy-just-to-be-alive pales in comparison. It's not just the physical addiction; being high is like a liferaft for some people, and those people need to learn how to swim.
policy_drugs_0_effect = Soldiers are more effective, consume Bath Salts and may become addicted
policy_drugs_1_effect = Bath Salts won't be consumed, may anger Pharmacists

policy_shower_name = Shower Rationing
policy_shower_text = There was plenty of water in cities during the first year, but evaporation's been taking its toll and it's getting harder to find pools or water towers that are even half full. We need a gallon a day each just to drink and wash dishes, but showers use over a gallon a minute. These might be a luxury we can't afford anymore.\n\n
How should we ration water?
policy_shower_0 = Reserve water for bare necessities
policy_shower_1 = Limit showers to once a week
policy_shower_2 = Unlimited showers
policy_shower_0_text = We really can't afford to waste water with a luxury like this. Literally _billions_ of people used to live without showers in 3rd world countries. Sponge baths work just fine and use a fraction the water. Deal with it.
policy_shower_1_text = You could survive for weeks on the water you use in one 10-minute shower. Our attempts to filter shower greywater to make it drinkable again haven't gone too well, mainly because we are so damn filthy. So for now one shower per week is a good balance.
policy_shower_2_text = Living like we do in the filth of humanity's downfall (not to mention the occasional spray of gore) is unhygienic. And a nice warm - even lukewarm - shower feels _sooo_ good. We'll let survivors shower as often as they need to stay clean and happy.
policy_shower_0_effect = No effect
policy_shower_1_effect = Increased happiness but chance of water shortage
policy_shower_2_effect = Increased happiness but chance of water shortage

# once loudspeakers are researched
policy_loudspeaker_name = Loudspeakers
policy_loudspeaker_text = The city's so quiet these days that you can hear our new loudspeaker announcements from twenty blocks away. Survivors passing through will hear it and come, but so will the undead if we keep it up for too long.\n\n
How often should we run the loudspeaker announcement?
policy_loudspeaker_0 = Broadcast twice a day
# higher chance of recruits arriving, zombies approach faster
policy_loudspeaker_1 = Broadcast every hour
policy_loudspeaker_2 = Never broadcast
policy_loudspeaker_0_text = We'll be cautious and only run it at 10am and 4pm.
policy_loudspeaker_1_text = We'll run it every hour on the hour. We need all the people we can attract, no matter the risk.
policy_loudspeaker_2_text = For now we won't use the loudspeaker at all. Who knows if there's even anybody alive out there to hear it?
policy_loudspeaker_0_effect = not implemented
policy_loudspeaker_1_effect = not implemented
policy_loudspeaker_2_effect = not implemented

# when researching zombie tech
policy_experiments_name = Zombie experiments
policy_experiments_text = Our engineers are researching the disease, but they tell me it'd be a lot easier if they had access to live subjects. The idea of having zombies in the fort makes people more than a little squeamish, but we might be able to make do with some infected rats or dogs.\n\n
Should we experiment on living creatures?
policy_experiments_0 = Use dead samples only
policy_experiments_1 = Experiment on infected animals
policy_experiments_2 = Experiment on living zombies
policy_experiments_0_text = Just the idea of having living infected - even animals - in the fort turns my stomach. If one got out... better not take the chance. It's gotta be twice dead before it comes in these walls.
policy_experiments_1_text = Experimenting on zombies would be way too dangerous, and more than a little inhumane. It's easy to forget those bloodthirsty monsters were - are - human in some small way. We should have enough respect not to torture them further, and will limit experiments to things like rabbits or mice that can be kept in very sturdy cages.
policy_experiments_2_text = When the next chance arises we'll secure a couple human zombies for our researchers to experiment on in whatever way they need to.\n\n
Finding a cure or some way to beat this disease is more important than qualms about animal testing or whatever. Those things are monsters - they can't feel pain. And even if they could, it's us against them, and science is the best weapon we have.
policy_experiments_0_effect = not implemented
policy_experiments_1_effect = not implemented
policy_experiments_2_effect = not implemented

policy_priority_name = Our Highest Priority
policy_priority_text = We need to determine the basic driving force behind society in [CityName]. This ideology will determine how other factions see us, and have subtle effects on our daily lives. Will we focus on growth, on the military, on religion, or wealth?\n\n
What is our highest priority?
policy_priority_0 = Repopulating the world
policy_priority_1 = Keeping people safe
policy_priority_2 = Providing a religious moral center
policy_priority_3 = Trading and prospering
policy_priority_0_text = Step one will be keeping people alive and fed. Step two: better food and living conditions. Step three: expand and repeat.\n\n
We will embrace families and welcome any who wish to join us.
policy_priority_1_text = No sense in getting high and mighty about our ideals if we're all dead. We need higher walls and more guards on them.
policy_priority_2_text = The separation between church and state is what put us here in the first place; we're not making that mistake again. What [CityName] needs is a government with authority that comes from a higher power. No hesitation and no doubt, we will execute the word of God and trust in the church to keep us on the right path from now on.\n\n
For those who disagree, we are offering religious conversions every Tuesday evening at city hall. Missing your appointment may result in your being declared a heretic.
policy_priority_3_text = We're planning to come out of this apocalypse with our pockets full. Many empires were founded on war, and ours will be among them.
policy_priority_0_effect = More new recruits
policy_priority_1_effect = Increased defense
policy_priority_2_effect = Churches are more effective
policy_priority_3_effect = Better trade deals


policy_property_name = Private property
policy_property_text = The question of private property is a sensitive issue in [CityName]. Some people wish we'd just leave them and their stuff alone. They wonder why we need so many laws and regulations to enforce what decent folks do naturally.\n\n
Others think the government should collect and distribute _all_ goods. Everything shared, and distributed to those who need it the most. That might work on a small scale, but can we run a society on those principles?\n\n
How much power should our government have over resources?
policy_property_0 = People share all resources
policy_property_1 = Some shared, some private property
policy_property_2 = People keep their own stuff
policy_property_0_text = Scavengers returning from duty must submit to a search if requested, and anyone suspected of hiding food may be docked rations until they either confess or are proven innocent.
policy_property_1_text = We'll try to maintain a balance between public and private property. New survivors can keep their personal belongings, but scavengers must deliver everything they find - no keeping candy bars and cigarettes for their own stashes.
policy_property_2_text = The right to private property will be upheld by the government. Anything people scavenge or produce on their own time can be kept or traded as they wish. The government has no right to interfere with survivor's homes or posessions.\n\n
If this results in some survivors being richer or better fed than others, it's probably because they deserve it from working so much harder than the others.
policy_property_0_effect = Produce more resources, lower happiness
policy_property_1_effect = Normal resources and happiness
policy_property_2_effect = Fewer resources, increased happiness


policy_wealth_name = Wealth distribution
policy_wealth_text = How do we decide who gets the best apartment, or who gets luxury goods like tea and peanut butter cups? Sometimes there's only so much to go around, and I know we're all equal, but maybe some of us are more equal than others...\n\n
If we don't give doctors better food and nicer houses, maybe nobody will want to be one. But if a doctor's kids grow up in a nicer house eating better food, they'll have more energy to study hard and become doctors themselves. Is that fair?\n\n
So who gets the best stuff?
policy_wealth_0 = Randomly assign luxuries
policy_wealth_1 = Favor skilled survivors
policy_wealth_2 = Favor the hardest workers
policy_wealth_3 = Favor soldiers
policy_wealth_0_text = Well I just hope I win the peanut butter cup lottery is all I'm saying. Hey, if I end up with a bunch of English Breakfast am I allowed to trade it for something else? Just saying I'm more of a rooibos and chamomile [man]...
policy_wealth_1_text = Competition is one of the main principles of capitalism. If we don't treat our doctors and generals better than some other faction, why would they choose us over them?\n\n
Sure people might complain that this is unfair treatment, but they're just jealous of the talent they don't have.
policy_wealth_2_text = It shouldn't matter how good a job you do so long as you try your best. There needs to be a just reward for people who work longer hours, try harder, and suffer more at their work.\n\n
So what if we attract fewer skilled survivors? If luxuries and status are all they're after, we don't want 'em.
policy_wealth_3_text = Obviously those who put their lives on the line for the rest of us should be rewarded for it with better stuff and higher status. They deserve it for their selfless self-sacrifice.\n\n
Though if they're only volunteering because of the perks of being a soldier, is it really selfless anymore?
policy_wealth_0_effect = Normal happiness
policy_wealth_1_effect = Happier high level survivors
policy_wealth_2_effect = Increased happiness but fewer skilled recruits
policy_wealth_3_effect = Happier soldiers and more soldier recruits


policy_crime_name = Crime and punishment
policy_crime_text = We need a policy for how we deal with criminals. I'm not talking, like, that jerk who borrowed my lighter but now insists he found it in an 8-12 last month even though we both know damn well that he stole it from me...\n\n
Anyway I don't mean him. I mean people who break the foundations of our ethical code. Murder. Treason. Unthinkable crimes.\n\n
How harshly should they be punished? Should they be rehabilitated? Jailed? Or is that wasted effort in a world where every bite of food matters?
policy_crime_0 = Take away their luxuries
policy_crime_1 = Put criminals in jail
policy_crime_2 = Kick them out of the fort
policy_crime_3 = Capital cannibal punishment
policy_crime_0_text = We need every worker out there. Assuming they're psychologically fit to work and won't be an immediate danger to others, even the harshest criminals will be allowed to do their time by hard, dangerous work.\n\n
They'll be given a curfew and have their shinies taken away until we feel their sentence is complete.
policy_crime_1_text = When you break the law, you lose your freedom. Not forever, because we don't want to have to feed you that long. Just until we feel you're rehabilitated enough to come out.
policy_crime_2_text = I can't think of a worse punishment than exile. Many survivors would rather die, I think, than be sent out there alone with nothing but a few day's food and a kick in the ass.\n\n
Hopefully this will be a harsh enough deterrant to make people think twice before commiting a crime here in [CityName].
policy_crime_3_text = Waste not, want not. And by that I mean... their flesh. Why send a criminal out to be eaten by zombies when their body could provide valueable food for us? So we will do the humane thing and perform capital punishment, then dispose of the remains in the most efficient manner we can.
policy_crime_0_effect = No time off, low order
policy_crime_1_effect = Criminals jailed, normal order
policy_crime_2_effect = Criminals exiled, high order
policy_crime_3_effect = Criminals eaten, high order


policy_nationalism_name = Nationalism
policy_nationalism_text = It's a dog-eat-dog world out there, both literally and figuratively. We've got to draw the line somewhere between us and them. Between cutting off all contact with the outside world, and giving our storeroom keys to the next guy who comes by asking for handouts.\n\n
We've also got a burgeoning national identity to consider. If we let just anybody join us, will they have the same ideals and values? Will they take our jobs and our place in society? Or will more immigrants make us bigger and stronger?
policy_nationalism_0 = Take care of our own
policy_nationalism_1 = Help our allies
policy_nationalism_2 = Help anyone who needs it
policy_nationalism_0_text = We built these walls to keep more than the zombies out; they protect us from raiders, thieves and freeloaders who are too lazy or damaged to work. If you have skills or goods to trade, we can talk. Otherwise, keep out.
policy_nationalism_1_text = "You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours" has been a good policy since the dawn of man. We'll strive to form alliances with the other factions in [CityName] and treat our friends well even in their times of need.
policy_nationalism_2_text = There are far too many people still out there who need help, and it's our duty to do what we can for them, without expecting anything in return. It's just the decent human thing to do.\n\n
Karma will find a way to pay us back.
policy_nationalism_0_effect = Increased defense
policy_nationalism_1_effect = Friendly factions will like us more
policy_nationalism_2_effect = More survivors will come to us

# Policy on kids. Need at least two kids, they are ducking around getting underfoot, do you: 
# let kids be kids, send to work with their caretakers, or send them to school if you have one. 
# Changes likelihood of goat events
policy_goats_name = Children
policy_goats_text = I don't mean to be all "Damn kids get off my lawn!" about this, but these kids really don't get the idea of being seen but not heard. They're always running around bugging adults who need to work, and if you tell them to get lost they do, literally, and need to be rescued.\n\n
This is what school used to be for, to keep them occupied for 8 hours a day so parents could have a break. Maybe we should re-institute them?
policy_goats_0 = Let kids be kids
policy_goats_1 = Kids help their guardians at work
policy_goats_2 = Kids should go to school
policy_goats_0_text = With all the pain and terror and heartache in the world today, who needs tedious lessons or the opressive regime of standardized testing. Let kids have their childhood... for as long as it lasts.
policy_goats_1_text = We'll assign children to work with their guardians as much as possible. They'll learn survival skills, which are far more valuable than anything we'd teach them in a classroom. Hopefully they'll be useful, and won't distract the adults from their jobs too much.
policy_goats_2_text = School is where kids belong. There's a reason we've been using them for centuries.\n\n
We're going to take turns teaching them for now, the same way we handle nightly guard duty. Not sure which is worse... but most of us are probably better suited to the latter. We'll assign them lots of reading and homework to try to keep them busy. Hopefully worrying about schoolwork will keep their minds off the horrors outside.
policy_goats_0_effect = Increased happiness
policy_goats_1_effect = Kids help more on missions
policy_goats_2_effect = Kids goof off less
