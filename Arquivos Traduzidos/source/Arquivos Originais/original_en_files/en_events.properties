warnUnhappy_title = Unhappy survivors
warnUnhappy_picture = sad
warnUnhappy_pictureColin = false
warnUnhappy_1 = I'll admit times have been tough lately in [CityName], but I'd wish the others were a bit more optimistic about it.\n\n
Sure, we've all got the runs from [Name's] terrible cooking and haven't had a [cigarette|beer|good night's sleep|bath] in over a month, but look on the bright side: we're alive! Most of the city's residents can't say that, can they?
warnUnhappy_2 = [Name's] been down in the dumps since [his] pet [rat|mouse|weasel] died. I had a talk with [him] and explained that we're all mourning little [Splinter|Ben|Ratty|Mr.Wiggles], but there's just no consoling the [guy].\n\n
I guess it's one tragedy too many on top of everything we've been through lately. Wish we had something to keep our minds off it all.
warnUnhappy_3 = Living with the constant threat of the [teeth-filled death|brain-eaters|decomposing dead] from outside the walls is beginning to wear on everyone's nerves. Not even [Name's] [shadow puppet|sing-along|interpretive dance|slam poetry] shows are helping anymore.\n\n
Hopefully things pick up soon or the zed are going to be the least of our worries.
warnUnhappy_4 = [Name's] been getting broody lately. Hiding in the shadows. Sulking on roof tops. I understand everyone is getting stressed, but I'm having trouble telling if [he]'s just depressed or if we've got the makings of a [masked vigilante|serial killer] on our hands.\n\n
Maybe things will improve if we can find some way to raise everyone's spirits.
warnUnhappy_5 = Someone has been covering our bulletin board with pieces of [emo|goth|dark] poetry. There's so much it's hard to see past it to the flyers for the next [rat bowling night|flea race|pick up-sticks tournament].\n\n
I suppose it's understandable given how bleak everything is, but I wish whoever it was would find another way to express their angst.
warnUnhappy_6 = A bunch of us were sitting round the fire when I got the sudden horrible urge to take a face-plant straight into the flames. It was like they were just calling to me, and anything would be better than this [miserable existence|urine-infested hell hole|never-ending purgatory] we've been forced to live in.\n\n
I shook myself out of it, but you could see the same despair on everyone's faces. Things are getting bad here.


suicide_title = Suicide
suicide_picture = grave
suicide_1 = [Name] climbed up to top of the wall surrounding out base and just threw [himself] off it into the waiting hands of the zed at the bottom.\n\n
I can understand things look bleak, but that was an ugly way to go.
suicide_2 = When we got up this morning we found someone had broken into our medical supplies and stolen all of the sleeping pills we had in there.\n\n
After doing a thorough search of the base we found [Name] lying on a rooftop, [his] body cold and rigid. It looked like [he] had been watching the sunrise as [he] took his last breaths.
suicide_3 = I found [Name] [in empty bathtub|behind an old shed|by the main gate] few hours ago, with a [switchblade|butterfly knife|razor blade] sitting nearby [his] lifeless hand. The blood on [his] wrists still damp.
suicide_4 = I should have been watching [FormalName] more closely. Life has been bleak for all of us lately, but when [Name] started withdrawing I should have seen the signs. If I'd realized what [he] was planning to do, maybe I could have stopped it.\n\n
We found [him] hanging from a ceiling beam in [his] bedroom this morning. No suicide note, but I guess what is there left to say?


# [Name] is the perpetrator, [Name2] the victim
fightInjury_title = Fight
fightInjury_picture = bar
fightInjury_1 = [Name] and [Name2] got in a fight yesterday. Some sort of lovers quarrel apparently, but no one was willing to give me details. It was over quick, but [Name2] got pretty badly hurt in the whole thing. We've all got hot tempers due to the crappy conditions here, and this is bound to happen again if people don't get some joy back in their lives soon.\n\n
Looks like [Name] feels terrible about the ordeal, but have the option to punish [him].
fightInjury_2 = [FormalName2] nearly got [his2] skull caved in when [FormalName] suddenly hit [him2] in the back of the head with a [folding chair|beer bottle] yesterday. Apparently [Name2] had been cheating at cards, but I have a nagging feeling [Name] is just a sore loser.\n\n
The stress is getting to everyone. If we don't find some way for people to decompress things are just going to get worse. Should we punish [Name]?
fightInjury_3 = [FormalName2] is going need some dental work. Seems [he2] had been [teasing|insulting|berating] [Name] and [Name] went and broke [his2] jaw. These things should never be solved with violence, but everyone is so on edge I'm not that surprised it happened. We could all use a little R&R, or whatever passes for that nowadays.\n\n
How should we deal with [Name]?
fightInjury_option1 = A few days of jail time
fightInjury_option2 = Kick [him] out of the fort
fightInjury_option3 = Let it pass
fightInjury_outcome1_picture = jail
fightInjury_outcome1_pictureColin2 = false
fightInjury_outcome1 = [Name] will spend the next few days locked up, so [he] can contemplate [his] crime. I think [he] really is repentant, and we just can't spare the resources to keep someone locked up any longer than that. Hopefully we'll be sending the right message to the rest of the fort.
fightInjury_outcome2_picture = gateStranger
fightInjury_outcome2_pictureColin = false
fightInjury_outcome2_pictureColin2 = false
fightInjury_outcome2 = [Name] was a bad seed. [He] was miserable here, and unlike the rest of us [he] wasn't able to deal with [his] emotions. We gave [him] a week's worth of food and supplies and a car with half a tank of gas, and asked [him] to get the heck out of town and never come back.\n\n
I think [he] took it pretty well, just gave me the finger, spat, and drove off. Hopefully that's the last we'll see of the [guy], but I'm going to be watching my back out there, let me tell you.
fightInjury_outcome3 = Some people are upset that [Name's] just walking around now as if nothing happened, but we need every available hand here. Hopefully [Name] won't cause any more trouble, but if conditions don't improve around here you never know.
# uses the options and outcomes from fightInjury, but somebody died so different text and image
fightDeath_title = Death from a Fight
fightDeath_picture = grave
fightDeath_1 = [FormalName2] "accidentally" fell out a third story window yesterday, just hours after [he2] and [Name] got in a heated argument. I'm worried more of these "accidents" are going to start happening if we can't get people to calm down.\n\n
We don't have any proof [Name] did it, but might want to punish [him] just to send a message.
fightDeath_2 = We never should have let [FormalName2] keep that [huge hunting knife|rusty machete|oversized prop sword] [he2] found. [He2] and [FormalName] got into a brawl yesterday, and [Name2] ended up dead with the thing sticking out of [his2] chest.\n\n
They're obviously both at fault, but [Name2] already paid for it. What should we do with [Name]?
fightDeath_3 = The problem with trying to make sure everyone has a gun to protect themselves is that when tempers flare, things can get ugly fast.\n\n
Though [FormalName] says the gun went off by accident, but it doesn't change the fact that [FormalName2] is now a corpse. We don't know for sure what happened, but might want to punish [Name] just to send a message and stop this from happening again.

# PEACEKEEPER perk prevents fighting due to low morale
fightAverted_title = Fight Averted
fightAverted_picture = bar
fightAverted_pictureColin = true
fightAverted_1 = [FormalName] interrupted an argument today at just the right time to stop what might have become an ugly fight. Tempers are flaring lately and I don't blame people for being pissed about the conditions here, but we can't tolerate fighting here.
fightAverted_2 = We're lucky that [FormalName] can spot when a disagreement is about to become a nasty brawl. [He] quietly stepped in between the two who were arguing, removed the broken bottle and chair leg from their grasps, and then got them to sit down and have a honest-to-god talk about what's really been bugging them.
fightAverted_3 = Night watch is always stressful, just waiting in the dark for someone to make a grab for you. When someone does, even if it just is meant to tell you your shift is over, your fight or flight instinct can kick in and before you know it you're in a scrap with one of your own buddies.\n\n
Luckily, when that happened last night, [FormalName] was close enough to pull them apart. [He] even ended up taking their shift so the two of them could calm down and get a proper night's sleep.

deserter_title = Deserter
deserter_picture = gateStranger
deserter_1 = [FormalName] just walked out into the empty streets of [CityName] last night. [He] didn't even take any supplies, just the clothes on [his] back. I knew [he] wasn't happy but [he] could have at least said '[Goodbye|Sayonara|Hasta La Vista|Au Revoir]'.
deserter_2 = I was going to have a conversation with [FormalName] after I heard [he] [got in a fight with someone|was the one who stole my dinner|left the main gate open] last night, but found [his] bed made and all [his] stuff missing.\n\n
Everybody's been pretty bummed out lately so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that people are leaving, but I'm worried at who might be next.
deserter_3 = [FormalName] ran out on us this morning. Said [he] just couldn't take [being trapped in here with us|the dreadful food|my horrible singing] anymore and left.\n\n
I didn't think it was as bad as all that... I wonder who else feels this way?


riots_title = Riots!
riots_picture = angry
riots_pictureColin = false
riots_1 = I woke up this morning to find a sign on my door that said: "[Remember comrades, every 8 hours of work is another 8 hours off your life!|The bosses need you, you don't need them!|Workers, feed yourselves, not the Zed!|Proletariat of the world, unite!|Eat your pheasant. Drink your wine. Your days are numbered, bourgeois swine]"\n\n
I think someone has been reading a little too much [Trotsky|Mother Jones] and we're not going to get much work done today.
riots_2 = Things have hit a new low. I had people throwing [rotten fruit|dead rats|rotten eggs|toilet rolls] whenever I tried to step out my door today. I can't even get close enough to say "Hi", let alone tell them what to do. Hopefully they get this out their systems by tomorrow.
riots_3 = Despite my orders, everyone blew off their chores last night and spent the night having a massive [rave|kegger|piss up]. I can't get anything more than a dejected groan from anyone today.\n\n
Hopefully they're willing to do some work tomorrow. The smell of [old beer|stale vomit] is getting to be a bit much.

# PEACEKEEPER perk prevents riots due to low morale
riotsAverted_title = Riots Averted
riotsAverted_picture = angry
riotsAverted_pictureColin = true
riotsAverted_1 = Today [FormalName] diffused a nasty situation that could have well gotten ugly. It started as a scheduling mix-up - my fault - and the confusion, coupled with the general low morale around here almost led to a total riot. It's a good thing we've got peacekeepers like [Name] around to help keep people calm.
riotsAverted_2 = I will always be grateful for [FormalName]'s calming presence. [He] can stand in the middle of a pack of growling dogs, or in this case a group of angry survivors on the verge of rioting, and come out with everyone smiling and wagging their tails. Although, that last bit might just be because of the fleas we've all got.
riotsAverted_3 = I know some people haven't been too happy with the way I've been running things, but I didn't think things were so bad that I deserved to have an angry mob on my doorstep when I got up this morning.\n\n
The only thing that kept it from blowing into a full-on riot was [FormalName]'s peacekeeping skill. [He] convinced the crowd that as bad as we've got it, we could have it so much worse.

theft_title = Food Theft
theft_picture = noFood
theft_pictureColin = false
theft_1 = Someone's been raiding the hen house. A couple of eggs we might have overlooked, but the [whole chicken|rooster] is going to be hard to replace. If it'd been a dog, there would be a mess of feathers as evidence, so I'm thinking it must have been one of us.\n\n
With the way morale has been lately, I could name three or four people angry enough to steal from the group like this. But we have no evidence of who did it, so there isn't much we can do.
theft_2 = A [crate of peanut butter|flat of turnips|bushel of dressed pigeon carcasses] seems to have walked out of our food stores. I'm not even sure what one person would do with all that, but this is evidence plain and pure that we've got disgruntled survivors in our midst.\n\n
We've got to cheer people up quick, or this kind of antisocial behavior is bound to put us all at risk.
theft_3 = Someone's been stealing from our farms. They're digging [turnips|carrots|cabbages] straight out of the fields at night when no one's around. There are no signs of forced entry anywhere on the base, so it must be one of our people.\n\n
I was halfway to organizing an investigation, when I realized it could have been any one of us. We're all stressed and too upset to do anything but look out for ourselves these days.
theft_4 = We did the storeroom tally today and found another barrel of food missing. Whoever's stealing it, they must be planning to leave soon. It's such a shame that in a world with so many dangers and hardships, we still can't trust our own.\n\n
People are just so unhappy lately, can we really blame them for wanting to grab supplies and get out of here while they still can?


depression_title = Depression
depression_picture = breakdown
depression_1 = [FormalName's] been real down in the dumps lately. Life is hard for all of us, but [he] seems to have reached [his] breaking point and hardly has the energy to get up in the morning anymore. I've seen this happen so many times in the last few years, what should we do?
depression_2 = [FormalName's] been taking things a lot harder than the rest of us recently. [He] doesn't show up to meetings anymore and has been eating dinner alone in [his] bedroom. I'm really worried about [him]. What should we do?
depression_3 = We found [FormalName] literally beating [his] head against a wall today. It took a few minutes just to snap the [guy] out of it. [He]'s frustrated and worn down from constant fear and pressure, but at least [he]'s still willing to talk about it.\n\n
We're going to sit [him] down this afternoon... what should we tell [him]?
depression_4 = [FormalName] was at the top of the wall at dawn this morning, screaming insults at the Zed on the other side. Worrying behavior if you ask me, not to mention dangerous to attract their attention like that.\n\n
I'm thinking [Name] might need some time off to pull [himself] together.
depression_5 = I'm not sure I should say anything, but [FormalName's] drawn away from the group lately and is spending a lot of time by [himself]. Everyone's depressed - what's new, right? - but I'm worried [he] might do something drastic if things don't get better around here.
depression_6 = I'm getting concerned about [FormalName]. [He] isn't eating anymore and just spends most of the day curled up under the flea-filled blankets in [his] room. [He] won't be hurting anyone but [himself] in there, but [he] is going to waste away if we can't get [his] spirits up.
depression_7 = I caught [FormalName] sitting in puddle just crying [his] eyes out. [He] wouldn't tell me what was wrong, just hunched there as sobs wracked [his] body.\n\n
I eventually got [him] to head to bed, but I'm getting worried that [he] could hurt himself if things don't change around here soon.
depression_8 = One of the mess-hall's knives went missing last night and [Name] showed up today with fresh cuts on [his] arms. I tried to get [him] to tell me what happened, but [he] just [flipped out of me and stormed out of the room|broke into tears|wouldn't even acknowledge my presence].\n\n
I had a couple of guys go through [his] stuff and remove anything they found that they thought could be dangerous, but we can't afford to watch [him] 24/7.
depression_option1 = Talk to [him] (need lvl 7 leader)
depression_option2 = Give [him] some time off
depression_option3 = Leave [him] alone
depression_outcome1_1 = We listened and stroked [Name's] ego for hours. It's pretty exhausting, playing psychiatrist to someone who's seen the horrors [he] has. But mostly [he] seemed upset about the current conditions in the fort, how everyone's just kind of surviving but not really _living_.\n\n
I promised we'd do our best to change things, and [he] seemed happy with that.
depression_outcome1_2 = It seems [Name] just needed someone to listen to [him]. [He] told some pretty awful stories of [his] survival over the last few years. I mean, I thought _I_ had it bad, but this [guy]... let's just say I'm impressed [he] hasn't given up completely.\n\n
The talk seemed to cheer [him] up at least.
depression_outcome2 = [Name's] going to take a few days off. [He]'s already looking a lot cheerier. If I didn't know better, I'd wonder if [he] was faking it just to take a break from work.
depression_outcome2_2 = I told [Name] to take it easy for a few days and [he] agreed that might be for the best. I gave [him] a pile of books to read, some of the classics like Robinson Crusoe and Atlas Shrugged.\n\n
Seemed to think I was giving [him] homework, but [he] perked up at the thought of getting a few days off.
depression_outcome3 = I told [Name] to keep up the good work and gave [him] a gentle punch on the shoulder. If anything, [he] looks even more miserable than before.
depression_outcome3_2 = I ordered [Name] to stop moping and get on with [his] work, but that seemed to make the [guy] even more depressed. I'm a bit I'm putting others at risk having [him] out there working, but we need everybody we can get. Hopefully [he]'ll snap out of it soon.


wantsToLeave_title = Survivor wants to leave
wantsToLeave_picture = gate
wantsToLeave_1 = [FormalName] says he wants to leave us and join [faction]. I guess [he] thinks they'd feed [him] better than we can. I don't really blame [him] for wanting to leave, but [faction]? Really?\n\n
Should we let [him] go?
wantsToLeave_3 = [FormalName] has been getting really friendly with [faction]. I think [he] may be looking to switch teams. The grass is always greener on the other side I suppose. And by greener grass I guess I mean higher walls and better food.\n\n
Should we talk to [him]?
wantsToLeave_4 = I got a message from [faction] this morning saying [FormalName] is asking to join up with them. I'm miffed [he] didn't come to me first with this, but I guess I understand. It's true, things have been going to hell around here, even more so than usual.\n\n
It might be good to have one of our guys put in the good word for us with [faction], so we could let [him] leave with our blessing. On the other hand, we really need [his] skills here.
wantsToLeave_option1 = Talk to [him] (need lvl 7 leader)
wantsToLeave_option2 = Bribe [him] with extra food rations
wantsToLeave_option3 = Let [him] go
wantsToLeave_outcome1 = We convinced [him] our fort wasn't such a bad place to be. We've got Fiesta Fridays now... although we're out of tequila and so far I'm the only one who shows up to them. Come to think of it, we could probably use some better facilities for throwing parties. Maybe a new bar?
wantsToLeave_outcome1_2 = I had a long talk with [Name] and promised that things are going to change around here very soon. I may have been lying, but I just couldn't stand the thought of the [guy] going over to those [faction].\n\n
Anyway, we're going to do our best to improve happiness around here from now on.
wantsToLeave_outcome2 = I think [Name's] just trading [his] extra rations to the others, but it seems to have made [him] much happier. I just hope he keeps quiet about it, because if the others find out they're all going to be threatening to leave.
wantsToLeave_outcome3 = I gave [Name] my blessing and sent [him] on his way. This could be a good move overall: one less mouth to feed, and hopefully [he]'ll put in a good word for us with [faction].


gateBreakdown_title = Nervous Breakdown
gateBreakdown_picture = gate
gateBreakdown_1 = [Name's] having some kind of breakdown. [He]'s waving a gun and threatening to open the gates beside the [square]. The zed on the other side are all riled up, maybe two dozen of them ready to pile through the instant [he] raises that latch. What do we do?
gateBreakdown_2 = We've got a pack of wild dogs prowling around at the gate and [Name] seems convinced that one of them is [his] old dog [Rover|Mister Bigglesworth|Yappers]. We've tried to convince [him] that there's no way the little guy is still alive, but [he] pulled a gun on us and started scrabbling at the gate.
gateBreakdown_3 = I think [FormalName] has been self-medicating. [He] got a shotgun from somewhere and is hanging around one of our gates yelling about taking on all the zed by [himself]. We need to stop [him] before he gets it open and we're up to our necks in undead.
gateBreakdown_4 = [FormalName's] lost it. [He] is at the gate next to our [square], screaming about how [he] just wants to open it and let the zed put us out of our misery. We tried to get [him] away from there and [he] pulled a gun on us.
gateBreakdown_option1 = Talk [him] down (need lvl 7 leader)
gateBreakdown_option2 = Shoot [him] first
gateBreakdown_option3 = Beg [him] to calm down
gateBreakdown_outcome1 = I managed to convince [him] to put the gun down. Hopefully we can keep [him] calm from here on out.\n\n
I think the stress of living here just got to the [guy]. It's been eating away at all of us for the past month, and we could all desperately use something to be happy about.
gateBreakdown_outcome2 = I shot [Name] in the chest. [He] died instantly. What else was there to do? [He] was clearly out of control and could have opened that gate any moment. It was either [him] or us. For the greater good of the people of [CityName], I acted quickly and without hesitation.\n\n
So why do I feel so terrible?
gateBreakdown_outcome3Gates = I tried to reason with [Name] but [he] was just too far gone. Before I could react, [he]'d opened the gates and zed came pouring through them. They pounced on [him] immediately, which bought the rest of us enough time to get out of there and seal off the [square].\n\n
I'll have to watch the others for signs of this kind of breakdown. We've all been feeling a lot of stress lately and this kind of thing's likely to happen again if conditions don't improve.
gateBreakdown_outcome3Gates_picture = zombiesAngry
gateBreakdown_outcome3Suicide = I convinced [Name] to leave the gate alone and walk towards me, but [he] wouldn't drop the gun. Then [he] got this crazy smile on his face, and all of a sudden I knew what [he] was going to do. [He] put the muzzle to his own temple and pulled the trigger.\n\n
We buried [FormalName] in a little garden at that same [square]. I know morale has been bad here and that's partly to blame for [Name's] death, so I hope we can turn things around soon.
gateBreakdown_outcome3Suicide_picture = grave


needCityhall_title = We demand a city hall
needCityhall_picture = gate
needCityhall_pictureColin = true
needCityhall_1 = [Name] is leading a small rally at the gates today to protest the lack of representation in [CityName].\n\n
"We need a city hall, and we need a real government, " [he] says, "If we wait any longer, it may be too late."\n\n
Other protesters who showed up seemed only mildly interested and were mostly there to pass the time. They declined to comment on the event, saying only: "what else is there to do anyway?"


######################################
# STARVATION
######################################

starveWarn_title = Starvation
starveWarn_picture = noFood
starveWarn_pictureColin = false
starveWarn_1 = Broth made from a single boiled anchovy is as tasty and nutritious as it sounds. If we don't find a new source for food soon we're in trouble.
starveWarn_2 = The survivors need food - badly! I wish real life was like a video game where we could find roast turkeys by smashing walls, but we don't have such luck.
starveWarn_3 = I know we're mostly city folk here, but we're going to need to figure out how this "farming" thing works soon or we aren't going to have the energy to lift a trowel, let alone defend ourselves from the undead.
starveWarn_4 = We're all suffering from malnutrition here. We need protein, fat, vitamins. My gums are bleeding from the scurvy and my teeth are starting to feel wiggly. I'd give anything for an orange or a lemon right now. Even one of those chalky Flintstones chewable vitamins that I dreaded every day of my childhood.


starveInjury_title = Starvation
starveInjury_picture = noFood
starveInjury_pictureColin = true
starveInjury_1 = [FormalName] is too weak to continue [missioning]... and I'm not sure [he] should even be allowed out of bed.\n\n
We found [him] leaning against the wall this morning, staring through a crack at the zombies on the other side. [He] said [he]'d watched them eat a live rabbit they'd caught, and wondered if they might let [him] share some of the next one.
starveInjury_2 = [FormalName] collapsed on the job today and is going to take a few days off for some bedrest. I'm worried... how is [he] ever going to get [his] strength back if we can't feed [him]?
starveInjury_3 = [FormalName] just came in with a twisted ankle and bad bruises down [his] legs. [He] was out foraging for fruit trees in the suburbs when it happened, but [he] wouldn't say more.\n\n
When I admonished [him] for leaving the fort without telling anybody, [he] told me he'd rather be killed out there than die of slow starvation in here with us.
starveInjury_4 = [FormalName] is very very sick. We think it's some kind of food poisoning from eating wild plants, but can't narrow it down.

# someone died and we ate him without options
starveAutoeat_title = Death from starvation
starveAutoeat_picture = grave
starveAutoeat_pictureColin = false
starveAutoeat_1 = [FormalName] collapsed today of what we think was a brain hemorrhage. It was probably caused by the severe malnutrition we're all suffering from. The good news is, [he] still had a fair bit of fat left on [his] bones. We're so sad to see [him] go, but [his] body will feed us and hopefully we won't succumb to the same fate.
starveAutoeat_2 = I used to tell [FormalName] [he] was so cute I could just eat [him] up. Now... it looks like that's going to come true. [Name] was killed today while out scrounging for edible weeds outside our walls. If we hadn't been so desperate for food, [he] wouldn't have taken such a risk.\n\n
Luckily we were able to recover [his] body. After a few words of parting to our old friend, we dressed and butchered [his] body like a deer.

# options to bury and (maybe) to eat him
starveDeath_title = Death from starvation
starveDeath_picture = grave
starveDeath_pictureColin = false
starveDeath_1 = [FormalName] was so hungry [he] tried to make stone soup last night. You know, like the old fairy tale? What the story doesn't talk about is the internal hemorrhaging that arises from trying to suck back a couple of liters of water and gravel.
starveDeath_2 = [FormalName] collapsed while trying to shore up a wall today. We tried to resuscitate [him] but it was too late. If we don't get some food soon, there's going to be a lot more like that.
starveDeath_3 = We're so hungry we barely have the energy to take a crap nowadays. Last time I did I found [FormalName] sitting on the toilet, [his] lifeless eyes staring at the ceiling and [his] pants sitting around [his] emaciated ankles. It looks like even that was too much for [him].
starveDeath_4 = What they don't tell you about starving to death, is how long it actually takes. A healthy adult can last a month without a bite of food, but if you eat grass and tree bark and the occasional rat, you can drag it out much, much longer.\n\n
Eventually though, everyone has their breaking point, and [FormalName] found [his] today.
starveDeath_5 = You remember those ads about starving kids in Africa, how they all had those swollen stomachs? That's called "kwashiorkor". It means "the sickness the baby gets when the new baby comes".\n\n
It's pretty rare in adults, but [FormalName] had all the symptoms when [he] died, including that horrible distended stomach.
starveDeath_6 = We're so desperate for food, [FormalName] started trying to trap crows on top of one of the buildings. It seemed like a good idea until [he] got mobbed by a murder of crows and fell to his death.
# added to starveDeath only if cannibalism is not an option
starveDeathNoEat_1 = [FormalName] lost it. Said [he] was sure that the zed outside were keeping all the food to themselves and decided to try and bring them down by [himself].\n\n
You can guess how well that went. I suppose it means we've got one less mouth to feed.
starveDeathNoEat_2 = The lack of food is getting to everyone. [FormalName] got into a shouting match with someone and stormed out of the fort. Not sure if [he] decided to leave us for good or got caught by something out there, but we haven't seen [him] since.
# added to starveDeath only if cannibalism is an option
starveDeathEatMe_1 = [FormalName] died today of pneumonia, probably a complication of the malnutrition we've all been suffering lately. It happened so fast, we haven't really had time to react. I played poker with [him] just a few days ago...\n\n
[His] last wish was that we don't bury [his] body for the worms, or burn it like we burn Zed. [He] wants us to eat [him]. [He] wants us to live... should we do it?
starveDeathEatMe_2 = By the time we heard the shot from [FormalName's] room, it was too late. I guess it shouldn't come as a surprise that [he] would put a bullet through [his] own head, though we're all deeply saddened by it. But here's the weird thing:\n\n
[He] did it while lying in a tub of cold water, and left a note saying "I couldn't keep going, but you can. This body is a shell. Don't let this meat go to waste.".\n\n
[He]'s implying we... eat [him]. Should we?
starveDeathEatMe_3 = [FormalName's] been too weak to get out of bed for days. It's clear [he]'s given up fighting malnutrition and illness and the stress of it all, and [he]'ll be dead soon.\n\n
[He]'s demanding that we eat [his] body when [he] goes. Yes, we're starving, and yes, it could save lives, but there might be some among us who object to doing... that.\n\n
Should we?
starveDeath_option1 = Bury [Name]
starveDeath_option2 = Eat [his] body
starveDeath_outcome1_1 = How shameful that we even considered the idea. We may be hungry, but keeping our humanity is more important than mere survival.
starveDeath_outcome1_2 = [Name] must have been delirious to ask such a thing. We honored [him] with a funeral pyre, and if the smell of cooking meat wafted by our noses at any point, nobody said a thing.
starveDeath_outcome1_3 = Who are we kidding. There wasn't really enough meat left on [his] bones to do us much good anyway.
# shown instead of outcome1 if the option to eat him was hidden
starveDeath_outcome1NoEatOption_1 = We buried [Name] under that [pine|fir|sycamore] tree [he] used to sit under. I hope [he]'s in a better place now.
starveDeath_outcome1NoEatOption_2 = We added [Name] to our local graveyard and we all said a few words. I'm going to miss the [guy].
starveDeath_outcome2_1 = I tell myself we had no choice but to eat [Name]. Our stomachs are a little more full, but did we lose some of our humanity in the bargain?


# Ate the Whole Thing - The survivors are so hungry, reporter eats something they shouldn't.
staveBadFood_title = Don't Eat That
staveBadFood_picture = hospital
staveBadFood_pictureColin = true
staveBadFood_1 = Did you ever hear the old joke: "My sister had an accident in the kitchen, and I ate it"? This time "it" was cupcakes. I know we're low on food, but what were those things made from? Mud? Urinal cakes? Wallpaper?\n\n
Whatever it was, I'm not going to be good for anything for a few days. If you'll excuse me, I have a date with porcelain god for the first time since I stopped drinking.
staveBadFood_2 = Did you know there are things swimming in the sewer? We're not sure what what they are but they're covered in mud and have [three eyes|hundreds of tiny little legs|teeth as long as my hand].\n\n
I should have known better than to eat the one I caught, but I figured protein is protein, and we're all just so hungry. Of course, protein doesn't mean help when it comes from something that gives you stomach cramps and turns you bright green. I'm going to be out of commission for a few days while this thing passes through my system.
staveBadFood_3 = With all the preservatives in their food, I always assumed anything from McNoodles would last for years. Unfortunately it seems their "food" can still go off, even if was made with 50% cardboard.\n\n
To be fair, the fact that the stuff I ate came from a dumpster probably didn't help matters, but I was desperate. It was days since I had last eaten a solid meal. Now I'm so sick I can barely stand.


# In tutorial diane offers ways to get free food.
foodDiane_title = Running out of Food
foodDiane_picture = noFood
foodDiane_pictureColin = true
foodDiane = Our survivors have been looking at me with puppy dog eyes at dinner, pleading for another helping. Just a few table scraps, they say, pleeeease?\n\n
Diane noticed too. She has some suggestions for how to get us more food.
foodDiane_option1 = Scavenging
foodDiane_option2 = Farming
foodDiane_option3 = Hunting
foodDiane_option4 = Trading
foodDiane_outcome1_picture = store
foodDiane_outcome1 = She took me into the city, to a corner store with bars on the windows and a huge padlock chained across the door. It might have deterred others, but not us.\n\n
We found a much flimsier wooden door around back and broke in that way. Chocolate bars, cheezies and energy drinks: all ours!\n\n
I'll have to remember this trick for later...
foodDiane_outcome2_picture = farm
foodDiane_outcome2 = Diane and I checked out one of our farms. We had some turnips planted, but they were small and sickly looking. According to diane, the soil was too dry and hard-packed, and probably low on nitrogen. We'll still grow _some_ food, but we could get more by actively farming.\n\n
The two of us spent the afternoon plowing the field and found some hidden potatoes while we were at it.
foodDiane_outcome3_picture = creepyWoods
foodDiane_outcome3 = Diane took me out to a nearby field to hunt. We moved carefully to avoid alerting zombies, and set traps instead of hunting with a rifle.\n\n
Traps are reusable, whereas bullets are a precious commodity. We checked back the next morning and found two plump rabbits and a grouse in ours.
foodDiane_outcome4_picture = gustav
foodDiane_outcome4_pictureColin2 = gustav
foodDiane_outcome4 = Diane explained that usually traders will find their way to us, but sometimes you have to go to them.\n\n
She's dealt with Gustav before and says his prices are high but at least he's reliable. We found his camp and traded him a few trinkets for some food.\n\n
Next time, he says, he won't give us such a good deal.

# BAD RANDOM EVENTS
######################################

madmanAttack_title = Madman Attacks
madmanAttack_picture = madman
madmanAttack_pictureColin = false
madmanAttack_1 = The end of the world hasn't been kind to most. Some guy covered in rags dug under the fence last night and started running around yelling at everyone to "Beware the Duck!".\n\n
He started to get a little too rough with [FormalName] and we had to put him down.
madmanAttackHospital_1 = [FormalName] caught someone trying to break into our store room today. The man was seriously unhinged, yelling gibberish and brandishing a rusty piece of iron. [Name] was stabbed pretty deeply, but we rushed [him] to our hospital, cleaned out the wound then sewed [him] back up good as new.\n\n
We haven't seen the attacker since... I can only hope he isn't still lurking around our fort somewhere. 
madmanAttackHospital_2 = It's a good thing we've got a hospital... I don't know if [FormalName] would have survived that stab wound otherwise.\n\n
Thankfully it wasn't one of our own. [Name] says the stranger lept on [him] from the top a building yelling "You did this! You did this!". [Name] managed to overpower him and killed the guy with his own knife. We're still trying to figure out how this madman got in.
madmanAttackInjured_picture = hospital
madmanAttackInjured_pictureColin = true
madmanAttackInjured_1 = Some nutbar slipped through the gate when one of our scouting parties came back and went after [Name] as if he had some sort of personal vendetta.\n\n
We managed to bring the guy down, but [Name] got pretty banged up during the fight. Hopefully [he]'ll be better after a few days rest.
madmanAttackKilled_2 = [Name] was investigating some strange noises on the roof of one of our buildings when [he] found a weird woman wearing nothing but her underwear. She was crowched over drawing strange symbols on the roof with a stick of charcoal and gibbering nonsense.\n\n
When she noticed [Name], she luged at [him] with a sharp piece of roof tile and put a deep gash in [his] leg. The madwoman lost her balance in the attack and careened past [him] and feel off the roof... of the 5 storey building. We've got a couple of guys cleaning up the road pizza now.


dogAttack_title = Dogs Attack
dogAttack_picture = dogsAttack
dogAttack_1 = A pack of stray dogs dug their way under the wall last night and ran amok in the fort. Those mongrels could have torn up half our supplies, but [Name] was ready for them. [He] shot the pack leader dead and wounded another, then the rest of them ran off.\n\n
We patched the hole in the fence.
dogAttackChased = A pack of wild dogs dug their way under our walls today and were halfway done digging into our food supplies shed, but our own pup {1} chased them off. I'm so proud of that little bugger right now. Good boy {1}, good boy.
dogAttackDeserted = Some half-starved and ownerless dogs dug their way under our walls today. We chased them off, but our own dog {1} ran off with them. I guess he figured he'd be better off with those strays than here in our miserable fort. Good riddance, I suppose.
dogAttackInjured_1 = [CityName] was beset by a pack of stray dogs last night. They got under the walls somehow and made a real mess of things, knocking stuff over and getting into the food supplies. Luckily they didn't get anything before [FormalName] confronted them, but [he] got a nasty bite in the arm for [his] efforts. At least [he] managed to chase them off.\n\n
Doesn't look like the bite carried any disease, but [he]'ll need a few days to recover.


illness_title = Illness Strikes
illness_picture = bedroom
illness_1 = It's hard to take advantage of the benefits of modern medicine without a hospital. [Name's] starting to turn a nasty shade of green, but without the proper facilities to take care of [him], [he]'s just going to waste away in that bed of [hiss].\n\n
All we can do is cross our fingers and hope [he] recovers...
illness_2 = Is bleeding from the eyes normal? [Name's] started doing it recently, but without a hospital we've got no way of treating it. [He]'s complaining of really bad headaches too so I told [him] to take a few days off work.\n\n
Uh... I hope whatever it is isn't catching.
illness_3 = [Name] suddenly dropped to the ground holding [his] chest and made a sound like a snake in a blender. We think it was [his] heart, but without a hospital we had no way of confirming it. Miraculously [he] didn't die though... seems like [he]'s recovered, though [he]'s really wheezy now.\n\n
We're giving [him] bedrest, the only thing we can do.
illness_4 = [Name] was digging through old dumpster when a raccoon went after him. Think the thing must have been sick, 'cause within a couple of days [he] was hallucinating and yelling at the walls. [He]'s confined to bed... and quarantined for good measure.\n\n
If we had a hospital we might have been able to avoid this. All I can say is I hope it's not rabies, because you don't recover from rabies.
# replaces above if we have a hospital
illnessCuredHospital_title = Illness Cured
illnessCuredHospital_picture = hospital
illnessCuredHospital_1 = It's amazing what bed rest will do in a properly sterile room without all those rat droppings covering the floor. [Name] was looking a little peaky, but after a couple of days in the hospital [he]'s all better.
illnessCuredHospital_2 = We all found out today that [Name] is really really allergic to bee stings. [He] went into anaphylactic shock and stopped breathing, but [we] managed to get [him] to the hospital in time.\n\n
Had to stick a tube down [his] throat to help [him] breathe, and pumped [his] heart full of adrenaline. Good thing we had a sterile environment and the right tools to do it.
illnessCuredDoctor_title = Illness Cured
illnessCuredDoctor = I used to be a doctor, so I recognized the symptoms of [FormalName's] infected wound right away. Thankfully it wasn't a zombie bite, just your run-of-the-mill bacteria. But it could just as easily been fatal if I hadn't seen [him] limping and cleaned that wound properly. Even the slightest scratch needs to be looked at these days.
illnessCuredDoctor_2 = [FormalName] had a fever for the last couple nights that seemed to be getting worse. I had to dig way back in my brain to my medical school training to recognize it as Coccidioidomycosis, a fungal lung infection that usually affects farm workers. Coccidioidomycosis... I can't believe I still remember how to spell it!\n\n
A little athlete's foot medicine in an ashma sprayer and voila: cured.

zombieBite_title = Zombie Bite
zombieBite_picture = hospital
zombieBite_pictureColin = true
zombieBite_1 = [FormalName] really should have known better than to wander outside the wall. Now [he]'s got a nasty new bite and we've got a bad problem.\n\n
[He] says it was just a dog, but nobody believes [him].
zombieBite_2 = Turns out [FormalName] got bit in the last zombie attack and was trying to hide it from us. [He]'s not showing any symptoms yet, but the rest of the guys aren't too happy with having [him] walk around the camp like this. [He] says [he] feels fine and just wants us to leave [him] alone.
zombieBite_3 = So [FormalName's] been getting really big on eating raw meat recently. I can't remember a time [he] might have got bit by the brain eaters, but I don't like the way [he]'s been eyeing [his] fellow survivors recently.\n\n
I approached [him] and asked to do a routine check for bites, but [he] refused to let anyone look. What should we do?
zombieBiteImmune = [FormalName] has been bitten by a zombie. Big chunk taken out of [his] arm, teeth marks clear as day. But [he] says [he] knows [he]'s immune to the disease, so it won't be a problem. How should we approach this?
zombieBite_option1 = Forcibly quarantine [him]
zombieBite_option2 = Wait and keep an eye on [him]
# hidden unless you have antivenom tech
zombieBite_option3 = Treat [him] with antivenom
# survivor lives but is angry
zombieBite_outcome1 = [Name] was pretty angry at having been locked up all night, and more so because we didn't believe [him]. Hopefully [he]'ll understand that we did what we had to do. There's no telling how people will react when they've been bit.
# survivor dies
zombieBite_outcome1Death = Good thing we locked [him] up, because by the next morning [he] was all dead and angry. We shot [him] through a crack in the door.
# everybody lives
zombieBite_outcome2 = The next morning I went to check on [Name] and found [him] reading in bed and looking perfectly healthy. [He] thanked me for believing [him] about the bite. Looks like we took a risk, but everything worked out this time.
# survivor dies, another survivor is injured
zombieBite_outcome2Death = [Name] turned zombie overnight and the [bastard] almost took [Name2] with [him]. Wasn't life threatening but [Name2]'ll need a day or two to recover.
zombieBite_outcome3 = The antivenom worked like a charm. Well either that or [Name] was telling the truth the whole time.
# disease vectors prevents it (50/50 chance)
zombieBitePrevented = Zombie Bite Prevented
zombieBitePrevented_picture = street
zombieBitePrevented_pictureColin = true
zombieBitePrevented_1 = It's a good thing we know how to recognize the signs of the disease and the vectors it spreads by now. [FormalName] found this sad, mangy little cat just outside the walls and was trying to entice it with a bit of salted fish. Then [he] saw the signs: the stiff-legged walk, the oddly dazed dead looking eyes.\n\n
Had to kill the poor thing, but then I guess it was already dead.
zombieBitePrevented_2 = [FormalName] might have gotten infected today if [he] hadn't remembered what we learned about the way the disease spreads by different vectors.\n\n
[His] face was sprayed by zombie gore during a routine nightly "cleanup" of the ones we can easily reach through the walls. Luckily [he] was wearing [his] safety goggles, and had an emergency wet-nap to clean and sterilize [his] face. If that crap gets in your eyes, you're a goner.


# farms produce 1/2 food for a week, prevented by the pesticides tech.
farmBlight_title = Farm Infestation
farmBlight_picture = farm
farmBlight_pictureColin = false
farmBlight = Our crops are failing. Some kind of bug is eating the buds and leaving a sticky white trail behind. Weevils? Slugs? Maybe we could research a solution to prevent this next time.\n\n
Our farms are going to produce less for awhile.
farmBlight_2 = The farms aren't producing as much food this season, and we don't know why. Might be some kind of fungus or insect in the roots that we can't see. We should research a solution so prevent this next time.\n\n
We will only get part of the regular food output from our farms for awhile.
farmBlight_3 = Our entire corn crop is ruined! Other vegetables seem to be doing okay, but the corn ears just wither and turn brown, and they're riddled with little holes like something's been eating them. I suspect some kind of bug is doing this, but we'll need to do some research to find out.\n\n
In the meantime, our crops won't be producing as well for awhile.
farmBlight_4 = Locusts! Like some biblical end times prophecy, they're swarming our fields. There must be some kind of pesticide or something we could use to deter them, but without the right knowledge all we can do is run around waving our hands trying to scare them off. It's not working very well.\n\n
Our farms will produce less food for awhile.
# replaces text above if we have pesticides tech
farmBlightPrevented_title = Farm Infestation Prevented
farmBlightPrevented_1 = Microscopic mites were attacking the crops in our farms this month, but the pesticides we developed worked like a charm against them. Disaster averted!
farmBlightPrevented_2 = Caterpillars make some of the most interesting nests, but we really don't need them setting up shop in our gardens. Fortunately they don't seem to like the taste of our leafy greens after we sprayed them with our new pesticides.


# unused
foodRots_title = Food Goes Bad
foodRots_picture = food
foodRots_1 = We lost some food to mold today. No sense in collecting fresh fruit from the trees if nobody eats it. We need to research how people preserved things back when.
foodRots_2 = Some of our supplies went bad this week, though I think someone would have been pretty desperate to eat that cat food anyway. We should research better preservation techniques.
foodRots_3 = I used to know a couple of people who would do a whole bunch of canning whenever harvest season came around. Wish they were still with us because we're losing a heck of a lot of food to rot nowadays.
foodRots_4 = I'm guessing we shouldn't be eating the nuts with the green fuzz on them. They probably wouldn't have gotten into such a state if knew a bit more about keeping things fresh.


# Digging Zombies - Bad Choice - Requires Farms
# [Name] = person who found zombies, not always used
# pick the farm closest to the middle of the map so we have a chance of getting the same one later
diggingZombies_title = Terror Underground
diggingZombies_picture = farm
diggingZombies_pictureColin = false
diggingZombies_1 = [Name] was out picking cabbages when one of the heads tried to take a bite out of [him]. It looks like the zombies have found some tunnels that take them right under our farms.\n\n
We can probably collapse the tunnels the zombies are using, but it might destroy the farm in the process.
diggingZombies_2 = [Name] was taking a midnight stroll through one of our farms when a hand suddenly burst out of the ground and grabbed [his] leg. [He] managed to get away, but it looks like we've got something worse than your standard garden pest on our hands.\n\n
We did some digging and found that the zombies have been tunneling under the wall. We can probably collapse the tunnels, but may need to rebuild our farms afterwards.
diggingZombies_3 = You know that plant, the mandrake, that supposedly lets out a dying cry when you dig it up? Well, zed make a similar sound when you pull off a foot or hand sticking out of your vegetable patch.\n\n
Zombies have been burrowing under our walls and have gotten into this farm. We should be able to collapse their tunnels, but the farm may be wrecked in the process.
diggingZombies_option1 = Collapse the tunnels completely
diggingZombies_option2 = Just plug up the exits
diggingZombies_outcome1Success = It was easier than I expected to collapse those tunnels, burying the undead deep underground where they belong. They're never getting out of there, but I keep imagining them still alive down there, trapped and scraping at the dirt for all eternity.\n\n
Luckily our farm didn't take much damage in the process.
diggingZombies_outcome1Fail = I've got to admit, the squishy sound of those zed getting buried in their own tunnels was satisfying. Unfortunately our farm is filled with rocks and rubble and lumpy uneven earth now. We will need to plow it back into a farm before we can start planting again.
diggingZombies_outcome2 = We did our best to patch up the openings we could find, but the tunnels are still down there and our walls won't do much good if a zombie can crawl right under it. Hopefully this won't come back to haunt us.

# Chance that we just put off the issue earlier and now we lose the farm to zombies
diggingZombies2_title = Terror Underground II
diggingZombies2_picture = farm
diggingZombies2_pictureColin = false
diggingZombies2_1 = We should have collapsed those tunnels under that farm back when we had the chance. Turns out they run right under the walls and all over our fort, and the zombies found another exit. They're pouring out of our farm like termites from a rotten log.\n\n
We managed to wall off that area so at least the rest of our fort is safe for now, but I'm not sure how long we can hold them in there for.


# Clogged Sewer - Hinders Scavenging
cloggedSewers_title = Backed Up Sewers
cloggedSewers_picture = dumpster
cloggedSewers_pictureColin = false
cloggedSewers_1 = You know, it was the little things that we used to take for granted before all undead business started going down. Things like clean towels, hot coffee, and the regular sewer maintenance.\n\n
Between the rains and the clogged drains the sewers are backing up something fierce and parts of the city are being flooded. It's going to be hard for our scavengers to find anything dry, let alone usable for the next week until the water recedes.
cloggedSewers_2 = At first we thought the horrible gurgling coming from the sewer drains around the city was because the zed had gotten down there, but it turns out it was just good old fashioned water getting backed up because no one has done any cleaning down there in months.\n\n
With all the rain recently the drains have started to overflow and large parts of the city are now foot deep in water. It's going to make it tricky for our scavengers to find anything useful until the water clears out.
cloggedSewers_3 = Have you seen the muck that comes out of a sewer drain when it hasn't been serviced for months and then decides to flood? It almost makes a zombie's face pretty by comparison.\n\n
With all the water in the streets our scavengers are going to have a rough time keeping out of the zed's way and finding anything useful until things dry up.


# Things Falling Apart - Some fort wall was badly built and is starting to collapse. You can spend 5 building materials to fix it right away, or have a level 8 builder presto-fixo, or choose not to. If you don't, you may lose the building immediately depending on how many zombies are on the other side.
# [square] = the owned building where the wall is failing
# [Name] = level 8 builder used to shore up the wall
fallingApart_title = Things Falling Apart
fallingApart_picture = walls
fallingApart_pictureColin = false
fallingApart_1 = The wall alongside our [square] isn't looking so good. It's not like we had much to work with, but in retrospect, we probably should have used something a little more robust than [shopping carts|old mattresses|volleyball netting] as its basis.\n\n
If we've got an expert builder on hand we could probably fortify what we've got, otherwise we're going to need to get some building materials together to build a new one.
fallingApart_2 = I knew we were rushing things when we reclaimed the [square] but I hadn't realized how slapdash a job we'd done until that undead creeper punched a new hole in it. We almost found ourselves neck-deep in zed.\n\n
It's either going to take serious building know-how to repair the wall we've currently got. Otherwise we're going to have to build ourselves a new one and hope the old one holds long enough for us to get something up.
fallingApart_3 = As much as I would like to claim that the chunk of wall falling off and crushing those zed that were trying to force their way through was intentional... it's fairly obvious that that section of wall was falling apart long before they got there.\n\n
If we want to keep the zed out of our [square] we're going to need to do some repair work fast. A really good builder might be able to fix the wall we've currently got, but it would be easier if we used some of our precious building materials to put together a new one.
fallingApart_option1 = Build a new wall (3 materials)
fallingApart_option2 = Fix the wall (lvl 7 builder)
fallingApart_option3 = Leave it alone
fallingApart_outcome1 = We managed to finish getting the new wall up just as the old one caved in.\n\n
I'll admit, it was almost worth it to see the looks on those zed's faces as they tore through breach only to come face-to-face with a second wall blocking their path, this one made of of 2 x 4s, barbed wire and duct tape.
fallingApart_outcome2 = [Name's] work is nothing short of extraordinary. Using some old thumbtacks, twine and a bit of chewing gum [he]'s managed to lash the bits of the old wall together to make an all new zombieproof barrier.\n\n
If I had to put money on a meeting between a Mack Truck and that barricade, I'd be going with the wall, all the way.
fallingApart_outcome3 = We left the wall as it is, keeping the terrors at bay for now. Hopefully the zed on the other side of it won't be able to get through it in its weakened state.

# happens a week later if we lost the danger roll during part one outcome3
fallingApart2_title = Things Fell Apart
fallingApart2_picture = zombiesWall
fallingApart2_pictureColin = false
fallingApart2_1 = The zed may not be smart, but with the strength to rip a man in two, they don't need to be. And against that kind of unnatural strength our rickety old wall didn't stand a chance. It's too bad we couldn't fix it up when we first noticed it was weakened.\n\n
We managed to get everyone out of there, but the [square] is a loss. At least until we can kick the zed out of there again.


# Zombie in the Hen House - Zed slips through and causes trouble. Stops worker production for the day. Requires someone in the fort doing something other than simple defense (IE Farming, workshop, research, etc)?
zombieHenHouse_title = Zombie in the Hen House
zombieHenHouse_picture = cornerZombie
zombieHenHouse_pictureColin = false
zombieHenHouse_1 = One of the zed snuck through our defenses this morning. We spent the whole day playing cat and mouse trying to find the thing and not get bit. None of our people in the fort got any work done today.
zombieHenHouse_2 = Dammit! I told them that wall of [park benches|port-a-potties|store mannequins] wasn't secure enough. One of the zed slipped through and spent the day chasing our workers around the fields before we were able to bring the thing down. I don't think anyone in the fort got a lick of work done because of it.
zombieHenHouse_3 = I think our lookouts must have fallen asleep on the job. One of those brain-eaters slipped through the defenses and was chasing the lot of us round the base like a wolf going after the sheep.\n\n
I managed to shoot the thing between the eyes but not before we'd lost a days work to the chaos.


# Banshee - A zombie with hyper evolved vocal cords has been screaming outside the walls for days. No one has gotten lick of sleep. Lower moral.
# Maybe give the option of stopping it by attacking a specific adjacent square?
banshee_title = The Banshee
banshee_picture = zombieHowl
banshee_pictureColin = false
banshee_1 = Normally when a person is turned all the undead husk is able to do is moan and occasionally growl. Unfortunately we got one of the rare occasions outside the fort where the thing still remembers how to scream.\n\n
The creature has been doing it non-stop for days and it's affecting everyone's morale. I hope it finds somewhere else to do this soon, or somebody kills it. I'd like to be able to sleep again.
banshee_2 = You know the story of the Irish undead, the Banshee? They say when you hear it's mournful cry you've been marked for death.\n\n
I sure hope that's not the case because we've got a zombie screaming it's lungs out (how does that work anyway?) outside the walls of the fort. I don't think it's going to kill anyone if we don't let it in, but it's not doing good things for morale to hear that day-in and day-out.
banshee_3 = I've never been one for death metal. It's always sounded like incoherent screaming to me. Kind of like what's going on outside the fort right now.\n\n
I think it's one of the zed, but whatever it is no one has been able to get a lick of sleep in days and it's hurting morale.
banshee_4 = One of the zed seems to have discovered it can still scream after death and now it's sitting somewhere outside the fort singing us the songs of its people.\n\n
I hope someone kills that thing soon 'cause it's driving the lot of us 'round the bend. Happiness is plummeting like a stone.

# complete the quest mission to kill the banshee
bansheeKilled_title = The Banshee
bansheeKilled_picture = zombieHowl
bansheeKilled_pictureColin = false
bansheeKilled_1 = We found that goddamn howling zombie in the [square] and put an end to it. It was in an odd condition: it seems somebody had attacked it with a sword at some point, and the poor thing was now walking around with the blade going right through its eye and passing through part of its brain. I suppose that might explain the constant wailing.\n\n
It didn't even defend itself or try to attack us, just stood there screaming until we finally put it down. We cleared out the rest of the [square] while we were at it, and kept the sword.

# banshee goes away on its own after a week
banshee2_title = The Banshee
banshee2_picture = zombieHowl
banshee2_pictureColin = false
banshee2_1 = The wailing zombie seems to have either wandered off or mercifully died. We can finally sleep at night again.


# something horrible is witnessed on a dangerous away mission
# they can drink it off if we have a bar
traumatized_title = Traumatized
traumatized_picture = breakdown
traumatized_pictureColin = true
traumatized_1 = [Name] saw something in that [square] that [he]'ll probably never forget. [His] nerves are just shattered, but [he] won't talk about it with anyone. All [he] would say is "God I need a drink" before [he] retreated to [his] home.\n\n
Too bad we don't have a bar for the [guy]... but [he]'ll come out when [he]'s hungry.
traumatized_2 = I'm not sure if was the threat of the undead or that cloud of bats that got in [his] hair, but something shook [him] up during that mission at the [square]. [He]'s probably going to need a couple of days to recover.\n\n
What [he] really needs is a good, stiff drink or two, but since we can't oblige some time off will have to do.
traumatizedDrink_1 = [Name] was white as a sheet when [he] got back from the [square]. [He] headed straight for our bar for a couple stiff drinks before [he] started to calm down. [He] still won't talk about what happened there, but it seems like [he]'ll be able to put it behind [him].\n\n
I tell you there is a time and place for alcohol, and this is it: to make your brain stop thinking when it's better not to.
traumatizedDrink_2 = [Name] saw something in that [square] that [he]'ll probably never forget. [His] nerves are just shattered, but [he] won't talk about it with anyone. All [he] would say is "God I need a drink" before [he] headed to the bar.\n\n
After more shots of moonshine than I could personally stomach, [he]'s drifted into a more relaxed haze. Looks like the booze took the edge off whatever happened in there... and hopefully [he] won't pay too much for it in the morning.



# Slavers - A gang of slavers has grabbed a survivor while on an away mission with at least one other person. Can pay them food to get the survivor back. Or attack slavers if combat high enough.
# FormalName/Name = Person kidnapped
# Name2 = person injured in failed rescue attempt
slavers_title = Slavers!
slavers_picture = gateGroup
slavers_pictureColin = true
slavers_pictureColin2 = false
slavers_1 = Zombies aren't the only threat in this lawless world. A group of frighteningly armed men kidnapped [FormalName] while [he] was out [missioning]. They seemed trustworthy at first, then snatched [him] so fast, we didn't know what had happened. Now they're demanding ransom and threatening to sell [Name] as a slave if we don't pay.\n\n
Honestly, I think these slavers are going to get more than they bargained for if they try to hold onto [Name], but we could buy [him] back for 20 food.
slavers_2 = [FormalName] never should have trusted those travelers when they invited [him] over to their camp to play cards. Turns out they're some kind of slave traders and they've taken [Name] hostage. Maybe [he] got a bit too nosy, or maybe they'd planned to kidnap [him] all along, we're not sure.\n\n
They're offering to return [him] in exchange for 20 food. If we don't pay up, according to these men this may be the last we'll ever see of our friend.
slavers_option1 = Pay 20 food
slavers_option2 = Try to fight the slavers
slavers_option3 = Let them take [him]
slavers_outcome1_picture = gate2
slavers_outcome1 = We handed over the food and got [Name] back. [He]'s exhausted, and ready to murder [his] former captors given half the chance, but otherwise none the worse for wear.\n\n
I feel bad having given in to these terrible people. I'm not sure whether to take their threats of "selling" [Name] seriously. Are there really people out there who _own slaves_? If so, it may be worse out there than I could have possibly imagined.
slavers_outcome2_success_picture = gate2
slavers_outcome2_success = I stalled, pretending to negotiate the price while the others snuck into position. We laid into the slavers mercilessly, cutting them down where they stood. After we put a couple in the ground, the rest ran off.\n\n
[Name] was grateful for being saved, but assured us [he] could have taken them all with one hand tied behind [his] back. I admire [his] spirit, but I'm not so sure it would have ended well if we hadn't stood up and fought back.
slavers_outcome2_fail_picture = grave
slavers_outcome2_fail_pictureColin = false
slavers_outcome2_fail_pictureColin2 = true
slavers_outcome2_fail = Our attack went terribly wrong. The slavers slit [Name's] throat before we could even get close to [him] and, to add injury to insult, put a bullet in [Name2's] knee as they left.\n\n
No human should never be the property of another, not ever, ever again. Slavery is one horror that I'm willing to fight to the death to oppose. I just hope [FormalName] would have agreed.
slavers_outcome3_picture = gate2
slavers_outcome3_pictureColin = false
slavers_outcome3_pictureColin2 = false
slavers_outcome3 = It hurt to say goodbye to [Name] but we didn't have the food or the manpower to get [him] out of there. Perhaps [he]'ll find a way to escape on [his] own, but I don't expect to see [him] again either way.\n\n
I wonder if we should adjust our policy on trusting strangers... if there are others out there like these slave traders, maybe we should just shoot first and ask questions later.

# hostile policy avoids slaver event
slaversAverted_title = Attempted Kidnapping
slaversAverted_picture = street
slaversAverted_pictureColin = false
slaversAverted_pictureColin2 = false
slaversAverted_1 = We thwarted a couple thugs today who tried to grab [FormalName] while [he] was out [missioning]. At least, I think they were trying to hurt [him].\n\n
Things happened so fast, I just reacted as we'd agreed in our policy: don't trust anyone until they prove they can be trusted. These guys had guns, and their hands on [Name]. Whatever their intentions, they're dead now.


# Mother Nature Hates Us - A natural disaster strikes, turning one of the fort's squares to rubble, not preventable
# [square] will be "rubble" by now so use {1} instead
naturalDisaster_title = Natural Disaster
naturalDisaster_picture = sunset
naturalDisaster_pictureColin = false
naturalDisaster_1 = Some gale force winds hit [CityName] last night. While most of the fort is ok, we now have a pile of rubble where our {1} used to be.\n\n
Someone tried to make a joke about a wolf and three little piggies, but it kind of fell flat. Just like our {1}.\n\n
At least we managed to rescue some building materials from it.
naturalDisaster_2 = After months without service, an old sewer main overflowed last night and flooded our {1}, destroying the supports and leaving the building pretty much unusable. We salvaged some building materials from it but that's it.\n\n
We're going to need to send some builders to clean up the area and put up something new if we want to use that space again. I really wish we had some hazmat suits to give them. Three year old sewage is a special brand of toxic.\n\n
naturalDisaster_3 = I'm beginning to wonder if [CityName] was built over a mine or something. Our first hint was when that massive sinkhole opened up in the middle of our fort, split our {1} in two and reduced most of the building to rubble.\n\n
We ain't seen nothin' try to climb out of the hole yet, but I ain't taking no chances. We're gonna plug up the hole with any ol' junk we can find and then the builders can put something new on top of it. Might 'a got some building materials out of it at least.

# Haunted - Demolish graveyard, bad things happen. Someone gets injured + morale loss.
# FormalName - Person injured
graveyardHaunted_title = Haunted
graveyardHaunted_1 = Yeah, it was creepy to repurpose the graveyard, but when the undead walk the earth I tend to be less worried about offending the deceased and more interested in putting barriers between us and them.\n\n
Unfortunately, [FormalName] is more "sensitive" than the rest of us, and [he] now believes [he]'s possessed by one of the spirits. [He] doesn't actually seem upset by this, but [his] behavior is creeping everyone else out. Last night [he] ate twelve ration's worth of pea soup and projectile vomited all over the place. [He] needs some bedrest.
graveyardHaunted_2 = The old country never leaves you, or at the very least it refuses to go away when asked. Since we converted the old graveyard to something more likely to keep us alive, some of the more superstitious among us have been declaring that the buried will rise from their graves to take their vengeance.\n\n
Seriously? I thought they already have. Still, [FormalName] is convinced that [his] sprained ankle is all because the spirits are angry. Personally, I think [he] is just clumsy.
graveyardHaunted_3 = Since we demolished the graveyard in the name of progress and survival all sorts of spooky noises have been coming from the [square]. To prove that there was nothing to be afraid of, [FormalName] decided to show us up and camp outside in the area overnight.\n\n
The good news is there was nothing supernatural to worry about. The bad news is [he] violated the territory of a local raccoon, who thrashed [him] something good. [Name] will need a few days to recover.


# Fire Bad! - One of the fort's buildings is set on fire. Can prevent it by using a fire station, or if water has been restored to the city.
# name - person who saw the fire started
fireBad_title = Fire Bad!
fireBad_picture = fire
fireBad_pictureColin = false
fireBad_1 = The thunderstorms have been really bad tonight. [Name] was out doing [his] best King Lear impression when [he] saw a lightning bolt strike inside our fort and the set the [square] on fire.\n\n
We don't have a lot of time if we want to save the building. We may be able to find some tools that can help if we've got a fire station, or if we've got the city's water running there's probably a fire hydrant in the area we could use.
fireBad_2 = I'm not sure how that zed set itself on fire. Or how it managed to slip past our defenses and get into our [square]. Either way it did and now the place is going up like a [*roman candle|tinder box|matchstick factory].\n\n
We might be able to save the building if we've got a fire station near by, or if we've got the city's water flowing. Otherwise it's going to be all we can do to stop the fire from spreading to other buildings.
fireBad_3 = Our [square] has caught fire! [Name] says that [he] saw someone [he] didn't recognize skulking around there and the next thing [he] knew smoke and flames were pouring out the building's windows.\n\n
We'll have time for investigations and the inevitable baseless finger pointing later, for now we need to do something to save the [square]. We might be able to find something to use in one of our local fire stations. Or if we've got running water, we could try the old fashioned method of using buckets and plenty of manpower.
fireBad_option1 = Use our fire station
fireBad_option2 = Use water from the mains
fireBad_option3 = Let the fire burn out on its own
fireBad_outcome1 = We're in luck! Our fire station had [*a water truck and the thing was still full. We used the pressurized hoses to get|enough fire blankets to cover a football field. After a fair bit smothering we got|a 5 gallon can of fire retardant foam. The building looks like it was dumped in a bubble bath, but we got] the blaze under control.
fireBad_outcome2 = Hauling water from the hydrant took time and every container we could get our hands on, but we did it. I never would have thought about filling a [construction helmet|backpack|picture frame] with water before now, but when you're desperate, you get creative.
fireBad_outcome3 = We managed to evacuate everyone safely and contain the damage but the building is now a smoldering ruin.\n\n
Someone tried to brighten things up with a marshmallow joke which was modestly amusing until we realized that a good portion of our stash went up in the flames.


# Epidemic! - Due to cramped quarters and lack of readily available vaccines an old disease (measles/mumps/chickenpox/the black plague/etc) has started racing through the fort and X survivors become injured. X is reduced if hospital is owned, or can spend 2X medicine, or can use Doctor Tech to prevent it entirely.
# Name = first person infected
# Name2 = another infected
# {1} = total number of sick including Name and Name2
# {2} = amount of medicine needed
epidemic_title = Epidemic!
epidemic_picture = bedroom
epidemic_pictureColin = true
epidemic_pictureColin2 = true
# no hospital
epidemic_1 = I knew that [Name's] spots were more than just bad acne. Turns out [his] parents were part of the anti-vaccination brigade and now we've got the measles running rampant through the fort. Two others are starting to show symptoms already. Without a hospital, we're having trouble diagnosing and containing it.\n\n
We can get this under control if we use some of our valuable medicine, though with the proper training our doctors might be able to make do without.
epidemic_2 = At first I thought [Name] had been been infected by the zed by the way [his] face was deforming, but it looks like [he]'s just come down with a case of the mumps. Unfortunately it's spreading through the fort like wildfire, because we don't have a hospital to help diagnose or quarantine it. Two others are complaining of symptoms.\n\n
We can use our medical supplies to get people up and about again. Trained doctors might have better luck.
# have hospital
epidemicHospital_picture = hospital
epidemicHospital_1 = Did you know people can still get the Bubonic Plague? I thought it had died out years ago but it seems when you're trapped into a tight unsanitary space full of rats and fleas, it can show up again. Good thing we have a hospital and were able to contain it! Only one other survivor, [Name2], is starting to look green around the gills.\n\n
We can probably cure them with medicine, though having trained Doctors might be just as effective.
epidemic_option1 = Treat them ({2} medicine)
epidemic_option2 = Have our trained doctors handle it
epidemic_option3 = Do nothing
epidemic_option4 = Use my own expertise
epidemic_outcome1_pictureColin2 = false
epidemic_outcome1 = It used up a whole whack of our medical supplies, but I think we got this thing nipped in the bud. We got the worst of the boils and fevers under control at least.\n\n
Everybody else should be back to work tomorrow, but we're keeping [Name] under quarantine for a few more days.
epidemic_outcome2_pictureColin2 = false
epidemic_outcome2 = With our proper doctor trailing, we were able to diagnose everyone's diseases and treat everyone's ills, all the while offering the fort-mandated convivial bedside manner.\n\n
Everyone should be back to work tomorrow, with the exception of [Name] who we're keeping quarantined a little longer.
epidemic_outcome3 = We've quarantined {1} sick people as best we can, but we're going to be pretty short-handed until this thing runs its course.\n\n
We also need to work out how to get food to the diseased without anyone else getting sick. Someone suggested making pizzas to slide under the door, but that would require us to have the makings of dough, tomato sauce and/or cheese.
epidemic_outcome4_pictureColin1 = false
epidemic_outcome4_pictureColin2 = false
epidemic_outcome4 = It's a good thing I used to be a doctor! I've seen this sort of disease before, back in Somalia during my stint with the Doctors Without Borders. I'd hoped I would never see such suffering again in my life, but here we are now.\n\n
Luckily I knew just what to do and we managed to catch this disease before it rampaged out of control. Even [Name] should be back to work tomorrow.


# They're Out To Get Us - The zombies in the local area are temporarily more dangerous!  Mission danger is doubled for the duration (1 week)
# Pulled in Mr. Blane, the fog event idea and the mummy ideas into this. Feel free to veto the latter if you still think it's too silly. =)
dangerousZed_title = They're Coming to Get You Barbara
dangerousZed_picture = zombiesEating
dangerousZed_pictureColin = false
dangerousZed_1 = I'm not sure what the local zed have been crawling through recently but going from the chemical smell it's something fairly noxious. What's worse is it has made the zed volatile. In other words, they now have a bad habit of exploding when shot, stabbed, or hit with too much force.\n\n
You might think this is a good thing, but having the creature in your face explode when you stick a knife it is just as bad as it getting its teeth in you. It's going to be extra dangerous to send people outside the fort until this chemical dissipates.
dangerousZed_2 = [Name] says we're in the middle of some rare astrological event. The [Occultation of Regulus|Draconids Meteor Shower|Conjunction of Venus and Jupiter] or something like that. While I don't really put much stock in that whole "stars controlling your destiny" nonsense, something sure has the zed riled up.\n\n
They've been way more vicious than usual, howling at the moon and actively prowling the city, looking for victims. We're going to have to be extra careful going outside the fort until they get back to normal. Or at least as normal as man-eating walking corpses ever get.
dangerousZed_3 = Some of the zed have gotten strangely clever lately. They seem to have figured out how door handles work. One of our scouts reported what looked like someone ordering them around, but I'm not sure how much stock to put into that.\n\n
Either way, we're going to need to be extra careful when going outside the walls while this bout of creativity lasts. Last thing I need is a zed opening whatever [*locker|kitchen cupboard|steamer trunk] I've made my latest hiding spot.
dangerousZed_4 = You know how old video games filled the background with thick fog when they wanted to hide the draw distance? Well, that fog can get really creepy when you have to deal with it in real life. Especially when there actually are vicious monsters hunting you the mists.\n\n
We've been trapped in fog for the past day and it isn't going away soon. The zed still have their keen hearing and sense of smell to track us, but we can't see them coming. It'll be more dangerous than usual for people going outside the fort while this stuff sticks around.
dangerousZed_5 = I didn't think it was possible, but the zed virus has infected the old corpses from a [local civil-war era cemetery|museum exhibit on ancient Egyptian culture|visiting Body Worlds exhibit]. They're slow-moving and falling apart rapidly, but these ancient zombies are swelling the ranks of the zombies out there.\n\n
Until those things have either decomposed or moved on, we're going to have to be really careful going outside the fort for any reason. The last thing I want to do is to run into [an undead red-coat soldier|a withered Egyptian mummy|a skinless plasticized corpse] in some dark alley somewhere.

# Crossfire, you get caught in the crossfire of two gangs who hate eachother while out on a mission

gangCrossfire_1 = [Name] was out of the fort on a mission when a few goons from {1} showed up. That made [him] nervous until, out of nowhere, a bunch of {2} started shooting at them.\n\n
[Name] dove for cover as the bullets flew from both sides.
gangCrossfire_option1 = Throw a brick at {1}
gangCrossfire_option2 = Yell out {2}'s location
gangCrossfire_option3 = Stay out of it
gangCrossfire_outcome1 = [Name] took a few pot-shots at {1}, much to the delight of {2}.\n\n
Eventually {1} ran off and {2} gave [Name] a friendly little nod as they went on their way.
gangCrossfire_outcome1_injured = [Name] started throwing bricks and any sharp garbage to-hand at {1}. Seemed like a great idea at the time until {1} started throwing it back. They got him pretty good with a rusty carburetor and [he]'ll take a few days to recover.\n\n
After {1} ran off {2} helped bandage up [Name] before going their own way.
gangCrossfire_outcome2 = [Name] helped {1} to get around behind {2}. I think {2} saw it coming and ran off but {1} were pretty happy with the help [Name] gave them.
gangCrossfire_outcome2_injured = [Name] tried to help {1} to get around behind {2} but they saw it coming and escaped by running right past [Name].\n\n
They gave [him] a bit of a beating on the run-by so [he]'ll be out of commission for a few days. At least {1} appreciated the help.
gangCrossfire_outcome3 = [Name] managed to duck out of the way and didn't get hurt.\n\n
You'd think with so few people left in the world we wouldn't be shooting at eachother.
gangCrossfire_outcome3_injured = [Name] made a dive for the ground but one of the bullets shot by {1} smashed into a nearby wall and [he] got a piece of shrapnel in the leg.\n\n
The fight broke up on its own and [Name] limped home for some bed rest.

[He] didn't see the thief, but [he]'s sure it must have been one of our own people. [He] wants our help in tracking them down and getting [his] {1} back.
badVigilante_2 = Apparently [FormalName's] {1} has gone missing and [he]'s convinced somebody in our fort stole it. [He]'s furious... I'm worried about what [he] might do if left do [his] own devices here. Assuming [he] can find the thief without our help that is.

[Name] came down on [him2] with a vengence, beat [him2] up and took the {1} back.\n\n
[Name2] surprised everyone by apologizing. [He2] said [he2] had been a moment of impulsive greed and it won't happen again.
# half the time it was a misunderstanding, FormalName2 not injured but gains REBELLIOUS perk
badVigilante_outcome1Rebellious = [Name] broke into people's homes until [he] found [his] {1} lying on [FormalName2's] kitchen table. [He] proceeded to take it back, break all four legs off the table, put them in the kitchen sink, then set fire to it.\n\n
[FormalName2's] the furious one now. [He2] says [Name] promised [him2] the {1} weeks ago, and they should have settled the misunderstanding without resorting to violence and table mutilation. Justice, [he2] says, was way overboard. [He2] has less faith in our fort's leadership now.
badVigilante_outcome1Rebellious_effect = Gained Rebellious perk
# lose the item and -20 happiness for [name] "Someone stole my " + equipment.type.name + " and we never found them"
badVigilante_outcome2 = We left more of [Name's] things in plain sight then sat there for days waiting for the thief to strike again, but they never did.\n\n
I guess [Name] won't be getting [his] {1} back. [He]'s miffed that justice was not served.
# roll 10 vs highest leader's level, on success no effect
badVigilante_outcome3Success = I got everyone together and did the old "We're all going to close our eyes now, and if someone has something they want to return, they can just put it on the floor and we'll forget this happened."\n\n
[FormalName2] interrupted me. [He2] stepped forward, mumbled an apology, and handed [Name] [his] {1} back. Wow, that was easy.
# lose the item and -20 happiness for [name] "Someone stole my " + equipment.type.name + " and we never found them"
badVigilante_outcome3Fail = I lectured to the fort for an hour about personal posessions and messing with the assignment of equipment, but nobody came forward to admit they'd stolen the {1}. Can't say I didn't try.\n\n
Well, [Name's] still unhappy; [he] thinks [he] could have gotten it back if we did things [his] way.

carrion_1 = We just spotted a transport helicopter flying above [CityName's] skyline like some sort of camo-colored angel coming to lift us out of this nightmare. And then it sputtered, spiraled, and came crashing down to earth just like all of our dreams.\n\n
It demolished the {1} it landed on, but there might be something to salvage from the crash site. Maybe even survivors? And definitely zombies attracted by the noise.\n\n
Not sure if we should send a scavenger, a leader, or a soldier. Or all three.
carrion_2 = An armor-plated school bus just went tearing down [CityName's] main street. Not sure why they were going so fast, but when they hit that [*fire hydrant|pile of corpses|newspaper stand] the thing really went flying.\n\n
We could see the explosion from here; looks like it took the entire {1} with it. Might be something to scavenge there, or survivors. Lots of zed in that area though. Not sure who we should send to take a look but they better be prepared for anything.

[He] directed us to a crate of medicine they'd been carrying when they crashed including a replacement medkit. Might as well take this with us, since [Name's] deceased friends have no more use for it.

carrionFinished_outcome1_outcome2 = Barely gripping to consciousness, the [man] said [he]'d come to look for [his] daughter who'd lived here before the infection. These strangers had kindly given [him] a lift, but one of them was bitten and very sick. She'd turned during transit and caused the crash.\n\n
I told [him] to hold on, but at that moment [he]... let go. [He] died.\n\n
[We] searched the rest of the wreckage and found a medkit. Tragic... we could have used that an hour ago.

Oh wait! A full medkit with everything we'd need... to... oh damn. Looks like the [guy] died while [we] were scavenging.\n\n
I put a hole in [his] head to make sure [he] wouldn't come back, and said said a few words, mostly "sorry".

carrionFinished_outcome2_success_option2 = Talk to the survivor
# colin joins but is injured, -1 medkit (the one we just found)
carrionFinished_outcome2_success_outcome1 = The [man]'s legs were crushed by the wreckage, but once we got [him] out of there and stopped the bleeding it didn't look so bad... just very, very painful. Barely holding on to consciousness, the [man], [Name], begged us to take [him] with us. We agreed.
# they die
carrionFinished_outcome2_success_outcome2_picture = grave
carrionFinished_outcome2_success_outcome2_pictureColin = false
carrionFinished_outcome2_success_outcome2 = Barely gripping to consciousness, the [man] said [he]'d come to look for his daughter who'd lived here before the infection. These strangers had kindly given [him] a lift, but one of them was bitten and very sick. She'd turned during transit and caused the crash.\n\n
I told [him] to hold on, but at that moment [he]... let go. [He] died.
# on fail find +1 medkit but they die
carrionFinished_outcome2_picture = grave
carrionFinished_outcome2_pictureColin = false
carrionFinished_outcome2_fail = It took [us] the better part of an hour to dig through the wreckage, mostly just a bunch of useless burned junk, then [we] finally happened on a medkit.\n\n
Unfortunately it looks like the survivor died while [we] were rummaging around... [he] probably could have used that medkit.



# Hidden Door - A hidden door leading to an underground bunker is found in a random square inside the fort, but strange noises are heard from behind the door. Can choose to open it or seal it up. If opened 50% chance of bonus supplies, 50% chance of horde of zombies which take over that square.
# Name = random living colin
# square = square the door was found in, use FortSquaresManager.getSquareToDestroy()
hiddenDoor_title = Hidden Door
hiddenDoor_picture = shed
hiddenDoor_pictureColin1 = true
hiddenDoor_pictureColin2 = false
hiddenDoor_1 = [Name] just found something odd. [He] was taking some quiet time in our [square], [*playing jacks with an old tennis ball and some rusty nails|reading a weathered newspaper of days gone by], when [he] stumbled on some hidden steps covered by debris.\n\n
The steps lead underground to a massive vault-like door. We're not sure what's down there, but [Name] thinks [he] heard scratching from other side. Do we want to open it to see what's inside, or just seal it up so no one accidentally lets out whatever's in there?
hiddenDoor_2 = [Name] got into a bit of an accident today. [He] found a [*huge SUV|cruiser motorbike|rusted jeep] that still had some gas left in the tank and decided to take it for a joyride. [His] crash in the [square] was fairly spectacular. I'm still amazed [he] was able to walk away from it. The vehicle wasn't so lucky.\n\n
The weird thing is the crash revealed this bricked up door we hadn't seen before. While I'd like to see what's behind it, I could've sworn I heard something moving on the other side. Should we open it, or seal it back up?
hiddenDoor_3 = [Name] was poking around our [square] to see if we missed anything in our initial scavenging sweep when [he] found an old-fashioned trap door that doesn't look like it's been touched in ages.\n\n
We've got no idea where it leads, but the few legible words scrawled on it ("[Danger... Man Eating...|Warning... Lethal Contaminants...|Abandon all hope... enter here...|Trespassers... Shot...]") don't inspire confidence. Do we want to investigate or seal the thing up?
hiddenDoor_option1 = Open the door
hiddenDoor_option2 = Seal the door shut
# 75/25 roll, on success +5 food, +3 ammo, +2 medicine
hiddenDoor_outcome1_success = The door led, somewhat anti-climatically, to a musty old store room. Aside from a few cockroaches, it didn't look like anyone had been down there in months, if not years.\n\n
What we did find were crates of canned goods, medical supplies and ammo. We're going to be celebrating tonight! [Anchovies|SPAM|Canned spaghetti] for all!
# square is lost, filled with zombies
hiddenDoor_outcome1_fail = The instant we cracked open the door, a hand that was more bone than flesh shot out and tried to grab [Name] by the collar. It was all we could to get everyone out of there and barricade off the area as the undead came pouring out of the hole.\n\n
Now we've got a small horde of zed trapped in the middle of our fort and nothing to show for it. Just another Tuesday I guess.
hiddenDoor_outcome2 = "Discretion is the better part of valor" as they say. I'm not actually sure how true that statement is, but the people who say it are generally the ones who survive, and that's what's important.\n\n
We spent a couple hours piling rocks and concrete in front of it, just in case. No one is going to be opening that door any time soon.

distrust_title = Distrust
distrust_picture = street
distrust_pictureColin1 = true
distrust_pictureColin2 = false
distrust_1 = On our way to [missioning], [we] passed an utterly wretched, twisted [man] lying in the road. I took [him] for a corpse at first, then [he] stirred and begged [us] for some food and water. I guess [he]'d just keeled over from exhaustion.\n\n
There is something odd about [him]. [He]'s got a big old shopping cart with a blanket over it. Plenty of room for food in there. Maybe [he]'s planning to rob us...\n\n
{1}
distrustOpen = But [we]'ve got to take this [guy] at [his] word... that's why we've got a policy of being open to strangers, right?
distrustHostility = This is why we have a policy of staying away from strangers. I'm not going to spend food on what is likely a trap.
# disabled if PolicyOption.STRANGERS_HOSTILITY.chosen()
distrust_option1 = Help [him] (2 food)
# disabled if PolicyOption.STRANGERS_OPEN.chosen()
distrust_option2 = Rob [him] before [he] robs us
distrust_option3 = Leave [him] there
# 75% chance he's telling the truth, -2 food, +5 fuel
distrust_outcome1_success = [He] ate eagerly. The shopping cart turned out to be full of propane tanks, which [he]'d been on [his] way to deliver to the rest of [his] group. They'd found a car that could run on propane and were planning to head north, where the cold made the dead sluggish and easier to run from.\n\n
[He] gave [us] one of the tanks to thank us, then [he] and [his] shopping cart trundled on down the road together.
# 25% chance he's lying, -2 food, -equipment
distrust_outcome1_fail = As I reached down to help the [man], a teenager in a trenchcoat popped out of the shopping cart and pointed a shotgun at my head. The [man] on the ground stood up easily, smiling, and pulled out a pistol. Oops.\n\n
They stole [our] food and equipment and ran off. At least nobody was hurt... just [our] pride.
distrust_outcome2 = The [man] protested and tried to get up, but I kicked [him] down. I pulled the blanket off the shopping cart. Some propane tanks, much heavier than it looks.\n\n
While my back was turned the [man] scrambled up and ran away. [We] didn't follow [him]. I'm still not sure if [he] was planning to rob us or not... I mean [he] did run pretty fast for someone who'd been collapsed on the ground a moment before. But I guess this fuel is ours now.
# -10 happiness to everyone on the mission "Where just left that person in the street"
distrust_outcome3 = [He] called after [us], begging [us] to not leave [him] there for the zombies. It echoed in [our] [p|mind|minds] long after [he] was out of earshot.

berries_1 = If you go out in the woods today, you might get... well you might get a poison ivy rash, but [FormalName] managed to avoid that. [He] did come back with a huge sack of {1} berries though... the thing is, we don't know what kind of berries they are, and whether they'd be good to eat.\n\n
What should we do with them?
berries_2 = It's amazing how quickly our parking lots and empty spaces are being reclaimed by nature. Anywhere a bit of dirt settles, or a crack forms in the pavement, life can take root. Before long those roots are ripping up the cement and asphalt and making way for more plant life.\n\n
[FormalName] was foraging in one of these reclaimed spaces when [he] came across a variety of {1} berry we don't recognize. What should we do with it?
# replace the result if we have already seen this berry and know what it's good for
berriesAgain_1 = If you go out in the woods today, you might get... well you might get a poison ivy rash, but [FormalName] managed to avoid that. [He] did come back with a huge sack of {1} berries though... and we've seen these before, we know they're  {2}.\n\n

berries_option2 = Throw them out
# hidden unless we know they are medicinal from earlier research
berries_option3 = Use them for medicine
# disabled if we already researched them successfully
berries_option4 = Research them first (engineering)
# 50/50 chance they are poisonous (based on color+cityid - medicinal ones are poisonous too), or +10 food
berries_outcome1Success = Hmm, well, we tried a few and they didn't seem to have any bad side effects. [FormalName] ate a whole handful - either brave or [he] was just really hungry. Seems like they're good.
# injured
berries_outcome1Fail = [FormalName] tried one. Well, it tasted good, and that's nature's way of saying something is good to eat, right? So [he] ate a couple more handfuls ([he] was hungry).\n\n
Then suddenly [he] couldn't feel [his] tongue. Uh-oh...\n\n
Yeah, [Name] is really really sick now. Shaking, vomiting, seeing visions of {1} gnomes dancing around the room. [He]'ll be lucky if [he] even lives through it. That was a terrible idea.
berries_outcome2 = We chucked them out. Not worth risking our lives for a tasty snack.
# +5 medicine
berries_outcome3 = Our best engineer [Name2] crushed the berries up and mixed them with some chemical lime from the ground up shell of a sea snail. Then [he2] either boiled it or boiled something else to add to it. I kind of lost track and it all seemed a little like alchemy.\n\n
The resulting powder, [he2] said, should be an excellent supressant for fevers and inflammation. Sounds good.
# roll 10 vs top engineer level. Show options again afterwards but grey research out. May unhide "use for medicine" now
berries_outcome4Success = [Name2], our best engineer, thought [he2]'d seen them on a book of local species once. Sure enough [he2] managed to find the reference - these {1} berries are {2}.
berries_outcome4Fail = We sent a sample to our top researcher, [Name2], but [he2] didn't manage to identify them. I guess there's one sure way to find out if these are edible...

survivorArrives_picture = gate
survivorArrives_pictureColin1 = true
survivorArrives_pictureColin2 = false
survivorArrives_1 = We found a [man] not far from our gates, where [he]'d been hiding out from the zombies for days. We suggested our fort might be a bit a safer than the garbage bin [he] was crouched inside when we found [him]. [He] seemed a little skeptical.
survivorArrives_2 = We were roasting some coyote meat over the fire when we heard someone knocking at our front gate. Turned out a passing survivor had smelled our dinner and wanted to know if we'd share.
survivorArrives_3 = We heard a noise from the other side of our wall today and found a [man] in the extended process of removing a zombie's head with a shovel. When [he] was done we waved [him] over.
survivorArrivesRadio_1 = Guess that radio's working, because some [guy] heard the signal and showed up today to see what all the fuss was about.
survivorArrivesRadio_2 = It may not be as fancy as a cellphone tower, but our radio's doing its job. A new [guy] showed up at the fort this morning after picking up the signal.
survivorArrives_option1 = Invite [him] to stay (50 happiness)
survivorArrives_option2 = Offer [him] 5 food if [he] stays
survivorArrives_option3 = Tell [him] to leave
survivorArrives_option4 = Kill and eat [him]
# happiness and give food options are the same
survivorArrives_outcome1_1 = [FormalName] will be a welcome addition to our happy clan. [He] says [he]'d like to settle here for awhile in [CityName]. The weather's nice, the walls look strong, and it beats running for your life alone in a city filled with the undead.
survivorArrives_outcome1_2 = [FormalName's] going to put up [his] feet and stay awhile. And why not? We humans have to stick together these days. We're social creatures; it's what we're designed to do.
survivorArrives_outcome1_3 = [He] introduced [himself] as [FormalName] and agreed to join us. Sounds like [he]'s not a bad [job], which we can always use more of around here.
survivorArrives_outcome1_4 = In this world we're living in, you've got to trust someone. I was alone out there for a long time so I know how it is. You'll go mad on your own... if you even survive. We've got to trust [FormalName] as much as [he]'s got to trust us.
survivorArrives_outcome1_5 = [FormalName's] one of the team now. [He] says [he]'s a decent [job], but will do any job that we need [him] for. [He] seemed pretty desperate to be inside sturdy walls for the first time in months.
survivorArrives_outcome2_1 = [FormalName] will be a welcome addition to our happy clan. [He] says [he]'d like to settle here for awhile in [CityName]. The weather's nice, the walls look strong, and it beats running for your life alone in a city filled with the undead.

survivorArrives_outcome2_5 = [FormalName's] one of the team now. [He] says [he]'s a decent [job], but will do any job that we need [him] for. [He] seemed pretty desperate to be inside sturdy walls for the first time in months.
survivorArrives_outcome3_1 = I told the [guy] we just don't have room for another mouth to feed. [He] seemed disappointed but nodded in understanding. "Sure," [he] said, "I get it."
survivorArrives_outcome3_2 = Honestly, [he] didn't really seem to know what [he] was doing. No supplies, no plan... how had this [guy] survived so far? Well hope [he] finds someone else to latch on to, because it won't be us.
survivorArrives_outcome3_3 = I felt terrible turning [him] away, but we just don't need another [job] here.
# also used in sawSign
survivorArrives_outcome4_1 = The [man] never saw it coming. I told [him] we'd start the grand tour in our kitchens, where [Name2] was waiting with a meat cleaver to do the job. Quick work.
survivorArrives_outcome4_2 = [He] didn't seem like a bad [man], but the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. And [his] body will feed many mouths and keep our children alive for one more month.\n\n
We must survive.\n\n
At any price.
survivorArrives_outcome4_3 = The [man]'s screams will haunt my dreams tonight, but we did what needed to be done to survive. Some of the others don't know... but I think they're starting to suspect.

# survivor arrives, but referencing our graffiti murals tech
sawSign_title = [He] saw the signs
sawSign_picture = gate
sawSign_pictureColin1 = true
sawSign_pictureColin2 = false
sawSign_1 = A [man] named [FormalName] showed up today. [He] says [he] followed the murals pointing the way to our fort from the edge of the city. I didn't even know we had them out that far, but it's a good thing. We could use more [job]s like [Name].
sawSign_2 = This [job] named [FormalName] arrived at the gates and asked to join us today. [He] says [he]'d been admiring our murals all around town for a couple days and figured we must be pretty organized to advertise like that.
sawSign_option1 = Accept [him]
sawSign_option2 = Reject [him]
sawSign_option3 = Kill and eat [him]
sawSign_outcome1 = Welcome to the team, [Name].
sawSign_outcome1_2 = Glad to have another [job] aboard.
sawSign_outcome2 = [Name] was upset that we didn't have a place for [him] here. [He] complained of false advertising, saying our murals claimed we were an "open community" with "space for everyone". I explained that times had changed, and [he] better get a move on before somebody got hurt.
# copied from survivorArrives
sawSign_outcome3_1 = The [man] never saw it coming. I told [him] we'd start the grand tour in our kitchens, where [Name2] was waiting with a meat cleaver to do the job. Quick work.
sawSign_outcome3_2 = [He] didn't seem like a bad [man], but the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. And [his] body will feed many mouths and keep our children alive for one more month.\n\n
We must survive.\n\n
At any price.
sawSign_outcome3_3 = The [man]'s screams will haunt my dreams tonight, but we did what needed to be done to survive. Some of the others don't know... but I think they're starting to suspect.

# two survivors arrive, but referencing our searchlights
sawSearchlight_title = They saw the light
sawSearchlight_picture = gate
sawSearchlight_pictureColin1 = true
sawSearchlight_pictureColin2 = false
sawSearchlight_1 = A couple bedraggled looking survivors are begging to join our fort. They look like they've been living on the edge of starvation for a long time.\n\n
One of them said [he] saw our searchlights last night from the edge of town and thought it was a sign from heaven.
sawSearchlight_2 = Two very cheery people are at the gates asking if they can join us. They say they saw our searchlights lighting up the sky last night and thought [CityName] looked like a pretty happening place to live.\n\n
It guess it is... if by "happening" they mean "still scraping by and holding on for dear life despite the odds."
sawSearchlight_option1 = Accept them
sawSearchlight_option2 = Reject them
sawSearchlight_outcome1 = [Name] and [Name2] have joined our fort.
sawSearchlight_outcome1_2 = Those searchlights really were a good idea I guess. I told [Name] and [Name2] they're welcome to stay with us as long as they like.
sawSearchlight_outcome2 = They were pretty bummed out that we had to turn them away, but after seeing the state of things here they weren't too surprised.

dayLaborers_title = The day laborers
dayLaborers_picture = gateStranger
dayLaborers_1 = There are three men at the gates asking for help. One of them is limping and holding a bloody rag to his neck, but he won't let us look at the wound. They want to patch him up with some of our medicine and stay the night. In exchange, they'll teach us a few things about construction.\n\n
These are quiet, honest looking men, but I suspect the one with the wound has been bitten. Should we help them?
dayLaborers_option1 = Let them stay the night
dayLaborers_option2 = Turn them away
dayLaborers_outcome1 = The two healthy ones, Rory and Diego, gave us welcome advice on putting up basic buildings the old fashioned way, without modern power tools. We should be able to build bars, churches, workshops and laboratories now.\n\n
Their friend David died during the night, though the medicine eased his pain. They bundled up his body and left with it, intending to bury him with his wife.
dayLaborers_outcome1fail = The two healthy ones, Rory and Diego, gave us welcome advice on putting up basic buildings the old fashioned way, without modern power tools. We should be able to build bars, churches, workshops and laboratories now.\n\n
During the night I woke to screams and gunfire, as their friend had quietly died then returned and attacked them. [Name] put him down before anyone was hurt, but it cost us valuable ammunition.\n\n
The remaining two left at dawn without a word.
dayLaborers_outcome2 = They nodded somberly and left. You could see in their eyes that they knew their friend was doomed. Medicine could have made him more comfortable, but it couldn't have saved him.

#If we chose nationalism:open then we get some random people showing up
nationalismSurvivorArrives_title = Open Immigration
nationalismSurvivorArrives_picture = gate
nationalismSurvivorArrives_pictureColin1 = true
nationalismSurvivorArrives_pictureColin2 = false
nationalismSurvivorArrives_1 = I guess word of our open minded ideas on Nationalism is spreading. [FormalName] showed up at the fort today saying [he]'s been looking for a group like us for a long time. Our policy is to accept anyone and everyone who comes by, so we welcomed [him] with open arms.
nationalismSurvivorArrives_2 = Back before the infection, it seemed like all the world's borders were getting tighter and tighter. We feared for our security and our jobs, and tried so hard to keep out the tired, the poor huddled masses yearning to breathe free (and work hard labor for low pay).\n\n
I'm happy we've rethought those ideas and opted for a policy of inclusiveness and open immigration. [FormalName] heard about it and came to join up. We're welcome to have [him]!

#If we chose priority:reproduce then we get some random people showing up

prioritySurvivorArrives_title = Repopulation

prioritySurvivorArrives_pictureColin1 = true
prioritySurvivorArrives_pictureColin2 = false
prioritySurvivorArrives_1 = Our focus on repopulating the world is bringing people in! [FormalName] and [his] {1} have joined us and are both very happy about our policy to embrace families and children.\n\n
How many empty towns and abandoned homes did they walk past to get here? Together we'll fill up all that empty space.

# do you eat them or keep them as pets?
foundRabbits_title = Bunny Wunnies
foundRabbits_picture = bunnies
foundRabbits_pictureColin = false
foundRabbits = I found some rabbits out in the [square] while [we] [were] [missioning]. Somebody must have opened their hatch to let them go free when the infection first started, and there are like dozens of the little critters now. Should we eat them or what?
foundRabbits_2 = [We] found a whole bunch of rabbits digging through one of our farms the other day. They must have been somebody's pets at one point 'cause they're surprisingly tame. We could just pick them up and throw them in a pot of stew soooo easily...
foundRabbits_3 = [We] [were] out [missioning] when we found a an abandoned pet store. The only survivors were a family of rabbits who had obviously figured out where the owners had kept the sacks of food and had done a fine job of keeping themselves fed, and multiplying very quickly.\n\n
What should we do with them?
foundRabbits_option1 = Keep them as pets
foundRabbits_option2 = Eat them all
foundRabbits_option3 = Half and half
foundRabbits_outcome1 = Rabbits for everyone!\n\n
While not providing any real material benefits, it's hard to beat the feel of soft rabbit fur against your face. Nuzzle wuzzle little wabby-wabbits, I wuv you...
foundRabbits_outcome2 = Rabbit stew for everyone!\n\n
Such a lean meat, low in fat and cholesterol but high in protein, this should keep us going for awhile. We didn't manage to catch all of them, so there are still some of the little guys out there to keep breeding.
foundRabbits_outcome3 = Rabbits for some, rabbit stew for others. Everybody wins!\n\n
Although it's a little disturbing to eat rabbit meat while you pet one sitting in your lap...

#If you run out of materials then a stranger arrives who gives you some more and tells you how to get more yourself
materialsGift_title = Bill the Woodcutter
materialsGift_picture = creepyWoods
materialsGift_pictureColin = hyman
materialsGift_1 = We're desperate for building materials and can't reclaim any buildings until we get more.\n\n
So I wonder if it's just a coincidence that someone just pulled up with a pickup truck full of lumber. His name's Bill and he's got a family waiting for him out in the hills somewhere. He's not interested in joining us, but maybe he can help.
materialsGift_option1 = Ask for free materials
materialsGift_option2 = Find out where he got the lumber
materialsGift_option3 = Invite him for lunch (-2 food)
materialsGift_outcome1 = Bill took pity on us and gave us a few boards, a sack of bent nails and some old fence posts.\n\n
He explained that he gets building materials from scavenging, demolishing buildings, or cutting down trees out at the edge of the city. Sounds like he and his family have a real stronghold out there.
materialsGift_outcome2 =  Bill said he gets materials from demolishing buildings, cutting them out of the woods and sometimes he finds good stuff while scavenging for supplies.\n\n
He gave some tips to our scavengers on where to find the lightest, strongest building materials. Something flimsy like a chain link fence won't keep zed out for long, but powdered cement is one of the most useful substances if we can get our hands on it.\n\n
We better get our scavengers out there to start looking right away.
materialsGift_outcome2_effect = Scavengers gained +1 level
materialsGift_outcome3 = Bill sat down and relished the simple meal we prepared him. He said he gets materials from demolishing buildings, cutting them out of the woods and sometimes he finds good stuff while scavenging for supplies.\n\n
Before he left, he told us about a nearby cache of materials we could have.

loner_title = Lone Traveler
loner_picture = gateStranger
loner_pictureColin = false
loner = A hardy looking woman's at the gates with her wolf-dog, her shotgun, and a big backpack. She doesn't want to join us, just asked if she could stay the night and move on in the morning.\n\n
I'm not sure if we can trust her, but she sure as hell doesn't look like she trusts us, either.
loner_2 = A woman with a nasty looking scar and a nastier looking wolf-dog are at the gates. Says she and her dog are just looking for a place to bed down for the night before they continue on.\n\n
She's got a steady, cold gaze that tells me she's seen some things out there, and may have lost some love for humanity along the way.
loner_option1 = Let her stay the night
loner_option2 = Feed her dinner and invite her to stay
loner_option3 = Turn her away
loner_outcome1 = She camped out just inside the walls and kept to herself all night. I tried to approach her at one point but that wolf of hers started growling and showing its teeth.\n\n
With a fierce beast like that I can see why she doesn't think she need anyone else, but even dogs can catch the disease. I've seen it happen.
loner_outcome2 = Over dinner the traveler shared stories of the world to the south. It doesn't sound like they're faring much better down there than we are, and a lot of cities were completely leveled in the fighting.\n\n
She and her dog are headed north in the hopes that colder winters will slow the Zed down.
loner_outcome3 = The traveler nodded curtly and left, heading north. She seemed to appreciate our distrust, maybe even approve of it.

# requires loner_outcome1 or loner_outcome2 and happens later during a mission
lonerReturned_title = Lone Traveler Returns
lonerReturned_picture = pawnshop
lonerReturned_pictureColin = false
lonerReturned = [We] [were] out [missioning] at the [square] when Zed jumped us and things went bad fast. Then this woman showed up out of nowhere with her wolf-dog and saved our bacon.\n\n
I remember seeing them at the fort a while back when she stayed the night. Good thing she seemed to remember us.
lonerReturned_2 = A group of zed tried to crash our mission at the [square] yesterday. Things would have gotten pretty ugly for [us] if that traveler with the wolf-dog hadn't showed back up.\n\n
After she and her dog made short work of the undead she saluted to us and left.

bonusFoodFertilizer_picture = farm
bonusFoodFertilizer_pictureColin = false
bonusFoodFertilizer_1 = We're thinking of having a contest of who can find the most amusing vegetable That new fertilizer of ours sure makes the things grow into some interesting shapes.

bonusFoodMorale_title = Bonus Food
bonusFoodMorale_picture = food
bonusFoodMorale_pictureColin = false
bonusFoodMorale_1 = A couple of the guys were joking around when they found someone's old earthquake supply kit in one of our buildings today and the thing was packed with dry goods. We're going to have a feast of oatmeal tonight!
bonusFoodMorale_2 = All this good will makes for hard workers. I don't think we'd be getting anywhere near this much food brought in if we were still having those daily knife fights.



bonusFoodFarm_title = Farm Bonus
bonusFoodFarm_picture = farm
bonusFoodFarm_pictureColin = false
bonusFoodFarm_1 = That swarm of bees that setup in one of the old barns has been doing great things for our farm's plants. I guess they've been having a great time getting fertilized regularly.
bonusFoodFarm_2 = That scarecrow making competition we held sure paid off, 'cause we've got more food than we know what to do with now that we don't have ravens stealing our carrots every night..
bonusFoodFarm_3 = I'm not sure where they came from, but a whole bunch of new plants have sprouted in our farms. So long as they don't suddenly start drinking blood and singing show tunes, I'm not complaining.



littlestHobo_title = Little Hobo
littlestHobo_picture = dog
littlestHobo = I met a strange dog digging outside the walls today, a handsome German Shepherd with a blue bandanna. When I approached him, he gave me a friendly bark, wagged his tail, then barked again like he wanted me to come over. I took a look at the hole he was digging. Turned out it found a whole bunch of [potato|turnip] plants we'd never noticed.\n\n
After he showed me his find, the fella wandered off. I think I'll call him London if I ever see him again.
littlestHoboReturns = No idea how that wandering German Shepherd London got through the walls, but we found him today, barking at this little shed we were smoking meat in. We barged in there ready to shoot whatever it was, and damned if we didn't catch [FormalName] scarfing down our half-smoked meat.\n\n
I was ready to beat the tar out of [him], but the dog jumped between us like he was defending [Name]. Boy was that [man] repentant. [He] and the dog went off hunting, and [Name] came back with a fresh deer, more than enough to replace what [he]'d stolen.
littlestHoboReturns_2 = London the dog turned up again. Managed to slip through a pack of zed with a whole rabbit in his mouth. Dropped the thing at my feet and simply left. Strange dog.
littlestHoboReturns_3 = I made a rookie mistake today. Saw a body with what looked like a backpack lying in the middle of the road and went to investigate, only to find the the corpse spring to life and try take my head off.\n\n
I probably would have been a goner if that wandering dog London hadn't showed up and tackled the thing off of me. Between the two of us we managed to finish it off and I got to keep the pack full of food.

frostypeg_title = Blood and Ice Cream
frostypeg_picture = gateStranger
frostypeg_pictureColin = false
frostypeg_1 = A pair of guys showed up at our gate today, one a hefty guy with a shotgun on his back, the other a wiry balding guy with a cricket bat. They said they were a couple former cops who'd taken to travelling the world after it ended, killing zed and meeting interesting folks along the way.\n\n
They cracked jokes like there was nothing wrong out there, no apocalypse, no end of the world. It was refreshing.\n\n
They said they'd kill for one of those old pre-packaged ice cream cones if we had any. Was that a joke too?
frostypeg_option1 = Offer them a beer instead (need bar)
frostypeg_option2 = Dig up an ice cream cone (need 8-12 mart)
frostypeg_option3 = Offer them water
# clear 50% of zombies in squares adjacent to fort
frostypeg_outcome1 = We took them to the bar and spent the night pounding back pint after pint of homebrew. I made myself sick trying to keep up with them, but it was worth it to forget things for awhile and just have a laugh with some friendly guys like the old days.\n\n
They were gone by the time I woke up (it was afternoon, admittedly). Looks like they killed a bunch of zombies around our walls when they went. Thanks, strangers.
# free cricket bat
frostypeg_outcome2 = Uh... they do know this city had no power for years, right? They said yes, of course, but they just wanted to see the wrapper for nostalgia's sake. I took them to our 8-12 and we dug a Cornetto out of the soupy, slimy mess that used to be an ice cream freezer.\n\n
"I can almost taste it." breathed one, and the other agreed. In thanks, the skinny one gave me his cricket bat. I joked that they must have some damn big crickets where he comes from to need such a heavy piece of wood to beat them down. He said man, you have no idea.
# nothing special
frostypeg_outcome3 = I got the feeling they had been looking for something stronger, but they still chugged down what we handed out. They said it was better than the stagnant puddles they'd drank from in the past while.\n\n
After they finished up their drinks they thanked us and headed out.


# rare singleton event, requires a dangerous mission (use Result.fromMission so [we] [our] works)

# reporter is mentionedColin
evilDarkness_title = Evil Darkness
evilDarkness_picture = store
evilDarkness = [We] [were] passing a dilapidated Allmart when [we] heard the sound of gunfire and swearing coming from it.\n\n
[We] snuck in and found this guy with slicked black hair and a a chin you could break rocks on fending off a small horde of zed. With each one he dropped, he let off a "Hail to the king, baby", or "I'll see you in Hades, yah scum-sucking deader!"
He wasn't doing so bad for a guy with only one hand and a book under the other arm, but they'll get him sooner or later. Should [we] help?\n\n
evilDarkness_option1 = Attack the undead (danger)
evilDarkness_option2 = Leave
# roll vs defense 10, on success get a regular chainsaw or KS_CHAINSAW_UNIQUE if Player.hasDeluxeVersion
evilDarkness_outcome1_success = I tore into the undead and between the two of us the store aisle was soon a sea of dismembered body parts and shattered zombie skulls.\n\n
The fella gave me his chainsaw as way of thanks for the the help. It was so coated with gore I'd be surprised if it still starts.\n\n
I asked him about the book he was carrying but he told me to mind my own business and get lost... so [we] did.
# minus happiness "I embarrassed myself trying to save that guy in the Allmart"
evilDarkness_outcome1_fail = [We] tried to help as best [we] could, but there were way more dead than [we] could handle. Fortunately [our] bumbling gave the guy time to pull out his chainsaw and make short work of them.\n\n
He gave a nod as way of thanks for distracting them, and told [us] to be on [our] way. I'm pretty sure I heard him making derogatory remarks about [our] competence as [we] left the building.
# no effect
evilDarkness_outcome2 = [We] left the guy to it. He seemed to be having fun after all.\n\n
As [we] headed away, [we] heard a strange noise like a rush of air and an implosion, then everything suddenly went silent. [We] went back to check and found the place completely deserted...

# Can we use {1} for a random item?
#mailMan_title = Neither Rain nor Sleet nor Zed of Night
#mailMan_picture = gate
#mailman_1 = We heard a knocking at the gate this morning. It was some traveler wearing a battered postal worker's uniform of all things. He said he was here to deliver a package for a [FormalName] and as soon as he handed it off, he left.\n\n
#Turns out it was a shiny new {1}. [Name's] got no idea who it came from, but [he] said anyone in the fort is free to use it.
#mailman_2 = [Name] was out looking for food when this woman in a torn postal worker's uniform ran up to [him] and thrust a package into [his] hands. Before [he] could ask where it came from, the woman bolted, saying she had other deliveries to make.\n\n
#[Name] found a worn {1} inside and passed it off to me when [he] got back, saying I could probably choose who could make the best use out of it.
#mailman_3 = Some old guy in a ripped postal worker's uniform came up to our wall today and called out, asking if there was a [FormalName] living here. We told him there was and asked us to pass on package to [him] before he headed out as suddenly as he had arrived.\n\n
#When [Name] opened it [he] found a refurbished {1}. We're not sure why [he] was sent it, but we'll probably find some use for it.

# But is it art? - The survivors take advantage of the reduced city population and get a small morale boost.
everyoneGone_title = But is it Art?
everyoneGone_picture = arsenal
everyoneGone_pictureColin = false
everyoneGone_1 = One of the advantages of post-apocalyptic burglary is the chance to own things that were well out of your price range before the zed showed up. And we've now gathered enough non-pretentious fine art that some of the citizenry decided to open up a museum.\n\n
We boast a Picasso, a Hopper, a Magritte, dogs playing poker, and my favorite, three-year-old Jenny's crayon and paper interpretation of a rabbit. Or maybe a dog. Or perhaps a rabbog.
everyoneGone_2 = We've been collecting paintings from the local abandoned art galleries to try and spruce up the fort. Now our walls are covered with some of the most expensive rivers and trees ever put to canvas.\n\n
I just wish the guys would stop trying to "improve" them. The last thing we need cresting over one of [*Emily Carr|Tom Thomson|Franklin Carmichael|Lawren Harris|A. Y. Jackson|Frank Johnston|Arthur Lismer|J. E. H. MacDonald|Frederick Varley]'s pastel-colored hills is another [*robot dinosaur|rolling ball of junk|fleet of flying saucers].
everyoneGone_3 = Back before all this hell started, I only used to have posters of [*sports teams|rock stars|movies|anime characters] on my walls. Now that we've got an empty city full of fine art to loot, I have a [*Rembrandt|van Gogh|Degas].\n\n
As for the red square on canvas stuff, a couple of guys put one up on the outside wall and it appeared to confuse the zed for a few minutes. If only we had a Jackson Pollack, they'd be paralyzed.

# {1} = number of people injured

houseCall_title = The house call
houseCall_picture = gateGroup
houseCall_pictureColin = false
houseCall_1 = I remember those "Doctors Without Borders" from before everything went to hell. True heroes. There's a group visiting [CityName] who are doing something similar to help those people struggling against the zed. These traveling doctors are offering to treat our injured, or leave us some of their spare medicine.\n\n
There's also a third option... we could try to steal all their medicine for ourselves. After all, they're here to help the needy, and who else is more needy than us?
houseCall_2 = A little [woman|man] showed up at our fort today wearing [*a long white coat with a red cross crudely sewn onto it|a stethoscope and one of those old-fashioned head-mirrors|some rubber gloves and an unsettling grin]. [She|He]'s part of a group of traveling doctors trying to help people in this godforsaken country we now find ourselves in.\n\n
[She|He]'s offered to treat our injured, or leave us some of [her|his] spare medicine in case something goes wrong in future.\n\n
Or... we could just take all [her|his] medicine and throw [her|him] out on [her|his] ear. It doesn't look like [she|he]'d put up much of a fight...
houseCall_3 = A heavily armored ambulance [covered in barbed wire, with spikes on it's wheels|with gun barrels sticking out of every door and window|with a flame thrower mounted on its roof] just barreled through the zed and into our compound. It belongs to a group of benevolent doctors traveling the ruins of civilization.\n\n
They're offering to help our sick or leave us some of their spare medicine in case of emergencies. But... well... if they have so many medical supplies that they're just giving the stuff away, how much more do they have crammed in that ambulance of theirs?
houseCall_option1 = Heal all injured survivors
houseCall_option2 = Accept 5 spare medicine
houseCall_option3 = Steal all their medicine (danger)
# heal all injured
houseCall_outcome1 = Those doctors flew through our medical ward like a hurricane of gauze, pills, and spray-on skin. Before long every one of our injured was right as rain. Or at least good enough that we can put them back to work.\n\n
You can still work with your leg in a cast, right?
# +5 medicine
houseCall_outcome2 = The docs left us some bandages, antiseptics, and syringes full of a strange green "cure-all". I just hope we don't need to use that stuff anytime soon.
# roll fort def vs I don't know, or maybe just random 50/50
# get +20 medicine and +5 medkits and -5 happiness from people for "How could we rob those innocent doctors?"
houseCall_outcome3_success = We beat up those doctors and took all their stuff. That'll teach them to work towards the betterment of mankind with no thought as to their own reward.
# injure 2 random colins
houseCall_outcome3_fail = I thought doctors were supposed to have some kind of "hypocritical oath" to not do harm or something... but they sure can get mean when riled up.\n\n
We tried to take all of their medicine for ourselves, but what we ended up with is 2 new bloody noses and broken bones. Now who is going to heal this lot?


# must have active hunting mission; use Result.fromMission to autopopulate [square] and [Name] and [we]
# The Big One - Your hunters have spotted a giant moose/wild boar/bear in the woods. Can send choose to send people after it. Requires survivor with both lv 5 scavenging (to find it) and lv 5 combat (to bring it down). Can be injured if insufficient combat. Gain loads of food. Requires someone to be actively hunting?
# reporter is mentionedColin
bigOne_title = Big game hunting
bigOne_1 = I just caught sight of the biggest wild boar we've ever seen wandering around the [square]. It's hide is a roadmap of scars and patches of fur, and it probably weighs as much as a small car.\n\n
What should [we] do? [We're] out here to hunt, and there'd be plenty of good meat on a beast like that, but that thing looks bloody dangerous. Boars can be seriously nasty when backed into a corner.\n\n
Or when they back you into a corner. It all depends on how the hunt goes.
bigOne_2 = I used to hear stories about grizzly bears coming down from the mountains and picking through people's garbage, but most  have the good sense to stay away from the remains of civilization now that it's swarming with undead.\n\n
The one [we] saw in the [square] today obviously doesn't have that good sense, but I guess when you're that big you might not need it.\n\n
Should [we] go after it? There'd be good eating on a bear like that, but it's dangerous game. If [we] don't kill it on the first shot... well, [we'll] wish [we] had.
bigOne_3 = In a battle between a speeding car and a moose I'd put my money on the moose 9 times out of 10. Those things are huge, irritable walls of horn and meat. And the one [we] spotted in the [square] [we're] hunting on is even bigger than most.\n\n
Should [we] try to bring it down? We'd be able to get plenty of food off something like that, but I've heard moose can fight back fiercely when wounded. Is it worth the risk?
bigOne_option1 = Attack it fiercely (defense)
bigOne_option2 = Track and ambush it (scavenging)
bigOne_option3 = Leave it be
# roll defense vs 10 or something, on success get +3 * DifficultyManager.foodPerBody worth of food
bigOne_outcome1_success = [We] flew at the beast and gave it everything [we] had. As I'd feared, the first hit didn't kill it, and it turned to fight back.\n\n
After a terrifying few minutes, I stood heaving over the thing's bloody corpse, the joy of death coursing through my veins, and I delivered the death blow.
# on fail, injury
bigOne_outcome1_fail_1 = [We] ran at the beast hooting and waving our weapons like animals ourselves. It was not a good tactic. The creature ran me over in its panic, and kept on running until [we] lost sight of it.
# harder roll vs 15 scavenging
bigOne_outcome2_success = Success! [We] tracked the creature to its lair, cornered it, and managed to kill it. Now all we need is few dozen pounds of salt and a good smoking shed and we'll have enough jerky to last us for months!
bigOne_outcome2_fail = I've no idea how something that big could be so stealthy, but it heard [us] coming and bolted. [We] tried to follow it, but not many tracks get left in these concrete roads of ours.
bigOne_outcome3 = [We] decided to leave the beast alone for now. Maybe [we'll] meet it again some day when [we're] better prepared.\n\n
Normally I'd be worried about the zed taking it down, but given the size of that thing I think the zed have more to worry about than that creature does.

# dog takes a bullet for a colin while on a mission
dogSaves_title = Man's best friend
dogSaves_picture = dumpster
dogSaves_pictureColin = true
dogSaves_1 = [FormalName] was on a brief break from [missioning], just taking a slash behind a dumpster and minding [his] own business, when armed men appeared at either end of the alley. [He] knew this was a dangerous mission, but thought if something was going to get [him], it'd be the zed.\n\n
[Name's] dog {1} went nuts, barking and stretching at the end of [his] chain. Not sure what these guys want, but from the way they're grinning it sure isn't good...
dogSaves_2 = [FormalName] knew [missioning] would be dangerous when we sent [him], but [he] agreed to go anyway. And... it was bad. The zed where everywhere, thick like dandruff, filling the streets and popping out of every possible hidey-hole in the [square].\n\n
You can only roll the dice so many times before they come up snake eyes. Luckily for [Name], [he] had [his] dog {1} with [him] when a zombie finally got the better of [him].
dogSaves_option1 = Let {1} attack
dogSaves_option2 = Hold {1} back
dogSaves_outcome1_picture = grave
dogSaves_outcome1_pictureColin = true
dogSaves_outcome1 = The dog fought like a hero, more viciously than [Name] had ever seen him before. But the dog wasn't doing it to same himself, he was saving his master.\n\n
Sadly {1} was killed in the fight, but it gave [Name] time to escape. [He] swears that mission was just too dangerous to begin with, and [he] wouldn't even be alive right now if the dog hadn't been there.
dogSaves_outcome2_picture = grave
dogSaves_outcome2_pictureColin = false
dogSaves_outcome2 = [Name] ordered the dog to get out of there, then stood to fight alone.\n\n
We found {1} scratching urgently at our gate some hours later. He wanted to lead us somewhere so we followed... he led us back to the [square] where his master, [Name], lay dead.\n\n
I know we should never have sent [Name] on such a dangerous mission in the first place. But can it be helped?


equipmentSaves_title = Helmets Save Lives
equipmentSaves_picture = breakdown
equipmentSaves_pictureColin = true
equipmentSaves_1 = It's a damn good thing [FormalName] was wearing [his] {1} today. [He] was out [missioning] when some sniper decided to have a go at [him]. Embedded a bullet right above [his] eyes, but thanks to [his] brain bucket it was nothing but a bruise.\n\n
Unfortunately those things are one use. I'm a little worried about leaving [Name] out there now without it... it's still pretty damn dangerous at that [square].
equipmentSaves_2 = [FormalName] escaped death today while [missioning] in [a] [square]. There's a zombie out there somewhere now with [his] {1} stuck in it's mouth like some cartoon character.\n\n
Hopefully one close call was enough for [Name] and [he]'ll be more careful next time... and yes there's likely to be a next time if we keep sending [him] on dangerous missions like that one.

#resourceMedicine_2 = I know [FormalName] is pretty bad right now, what with the way [his] [sores are oozing puss|elbow is twisting back like that|body twitches whenever we poke the embedded shard of glass], but I'm sure we could fix that right up with a good dose of medicine. Assuming we've got some on hand.
#resourceMedicine_3 = [FormalName] isn't feeling so hot. To be fair, I wouldn't either if I [was throwing up every couple of hours|was missing half my face|had a whole-body rash like that]. We could probably speed up [his] recovery if we're willing to use up some of our valuable medicine.

#resourceMedicine_outcome2 = We decided to hang onto our prized medicine for a more serious emergency. [Name] is just going to have to suck it up and get better the old fashioned way; with plenty of sunlight, bed rest and chicken soup.\n\n

I hate zed as much next person, but if we use up all our ammo blowing off steam, what are we going to do next some unfriendly gang decides we look like a easy target?
resourceAmmo_2 = Ah jeez. [FormalName's] running around the fort pretending to blow away imaginary zed with [his] {1} today. What is [he], five?\n\n
It won't be long before [he] requests some ammo to go out and shoot zed from the walls. Maybe it'll do some good... or maybe just piss the rest of them off if [he] doesn't do it carefully. What should I tell [him] when [he] comes asking?
resourceAmmo_3 = [FormalName]'s been in a dark place recently. [He] spends all [his] time muttering to [himself] and cradling that {1} of [his].\n\n
I suppose we could give [him] the extra ammo [he]'s been asking for and let [him] vent [his] frustrations on the zed in the old [square] outside. I'm pretty sure [he]'d go after them... and not us.

# kill all zed including zombie unit, and [Name] and [Name2] are now ENEMY
# -10 happiness to Name2 for result.mentionedColin.formalName + " shot at me, that jerk!"
resourceAmmo_outcome2 = [Name] went... ahem... a little nuts with all that ammunition. [He] sprayed down all the zed in the [square], then started shooting cans, trees, birds, whatever. Nearly blew a hole in [Name2] who was coming back home late. Made an enemy there, for sure.

# singleton, don't do if there is a goat or survivor named "Lily" in the fort
# Stranger needs medicine - A young girl, maybe a child, shows up at the fort asking for medicine for her sick mommy/daddy/brother/something. You have the option to turn her away, give it to her, try to convince her to stay. Trying to convince her never works and either scares her away (depending on leadership skill), or she says she'll talk to her mommy about it and you are lead back to the other two options. If you successfully tried to convince her to stay and gave her the medicine, she'll come back with her mom in a few months and join you. If you have medicine but tell her to eff off, a random survivor witnesses and gets upset about it (- happiness)

medicineStranger_pictureColin2 = true
medicineStranger_1 = [Name2] heard crying behind a [square] today and found a little girl hiding in a parked car, her tears streaking the dirt on her face.\n\n
Her name is Lily. Her dad had been keeping her safe since the zed started to rise, but a few days ago he came down with a fever that left him bedridden and useless. Lily had set out on her own to find antibiotics.\n\n
She's cagey and refuses to say where they're staying. I'm worried her father might not even be alive anymore.
medicineStranger_2 = We met a young girl named Lily today when she crashed a car into our wall. She must be about 8 years old, so small her feet couldn't reach the pedals. But she was trying, she said, to find medicine for her dad, who was delirious and coughing up blood back at their safehouse.\n\n
That was a week ago. We might have some medicine that could help, but from the sound of it her dad could already be gone. It might be better for Lily if we can convince her to stay with us.
medicineStranger_3 = We found a little girl picking through garbage outside our wall this morning. Her hair was black with grime and I'm not sure when she last ate. She told me her name was Lily.\n\n
I asked her how she had survived this long and she told me her dad had been keeping her safe, but now that he's come down with a fever, Lily's out searching for some way to make him better.\n\
It looks like she might have been on her own for awhile. We could give her some medicine, but is her father even still alive out there?

medicineStranger_option3 = Turn her away
medicineStranger_outcome1 = Lily's eyes widened when I handed her the package of antibiotics and before I could offer to go with her, she turned and disappeared into [CityName]'s ruined streets.
medicineStranger_outcome2 = During a long, difficult talk, we explained to Lily that her father had sent her away not to find medicine, but because he didn't want her to watch him die. Going back would be too dangerous now, and no use to him. Staying with us, where it is safe, is what her father would have wanted.\n\n
After a long cry and some hot soup, Lily agreed to stay. She hasn't said much since then, but I think this is for the best.

She put her small hands on mine, thanked me for my time and then turned and wandered dejectedly back into [CityName's] dark streets.

# Faction needs medicine - Random member of a random faction appears and tells you that their leader is hurt somehow and needs some specific medicine. Option to give it to them, say you don't have any, say you can't spare it, or demand to talk to the leader first because you don't believe him. Last option makes him defensive or upset and leads back to first three. If you give it to him, faction respect and strength increases. Saying no for either reason lowers faction strength (because the leader's wounded).

We could have eradicated [mumps|measles|chicken pox]... instead now it's coming back to hurt the next generation.\n\n
[FactionLeader]'s asking if we have medicine to spare. Do we?
resourceMedicineFaction_2 = [FactionLeader's] always been so cocky, it's kind of gratifying to see [factionHim] brought low by a simple flu bug. [FactionHe] came by with some of [factionHis] crew to ask if we have any [stomach medicine|antibiotics|nausea medication] to spare.\n\n
Now I'm kind of wishing I hadn't shaken [factionHis] hand just now.
resourceMedicineFaction_3 = [FactionLeader] stopped by to request some antibiotics from us. [FactionHe] claims [factionHe] [stepped on a rusty nail|walked into some barbed wire|got a nasty splinter] and the wound has gotten infected.\n\n
I'm not sure I buy it. [FactionLeader] didn't become the leader of [faction] by being that careless. Of course, if [factionHe] does really need it, the gratitude could be worth it. We need all the friends we can get out here.
resourceMedicineFaction_option1 = Give [factionHim] 5 medicine
resourceMedicineFaction_option2 = Offer to treat the patient
resourceMedicineFaction_option3 = Say no
# +5 strength +5 respect
resourceMedicineFaction_outcome1 = [Faction] are a little stronger now, whether they actually needed the medicine or not. I just hope [FactionLeader] remembers where [factionHe] got it from.
# leads back to the three options again but this one is disabled
resourceMedicineFaction_outcome2 = [FactionLeader] got really defensive when I suggested our people might be able to help... [factionHe] seems to think we don't believe [factionHim], and says their doctors are perfectly capable of treating patients without our help.\n\n
I guess we either give [factionHim] the medicine, or we don't.
# -5 strength -5 respect
resourceMedicineFaction_outcome3 = I told [factionHim] we didn't have any to spare. [FactionLeader's] just going to have to find someone else to mooch off of.

# Better, Faster, Stronger - Find a secret lab. While the lab is falling apart, there are sufficient supplies to allow you to augment one survivor with cutting-edge prosthetics. If choose to try it, that survivor either gains Superhero perk (50%), or Sickly (50%). Make this one time location event like the "Big One"?
# Name - Person who finds lab
# square - Place lab is in
#bodyAugment_title = Better, Faster, Stronger
#bodyAugment_1 = We just got word [FormalName] found some sort of secret lab hidden under the [square]. With all of the Tesla coils and beakers of strange coloured liquid it looks like the sort of place [*Dr.Frankenstein|Dr.Jekyll] would be right at home in.\n\n
#The centerpiece of the lab was a glowing beaker labeled "[*Power Warrior Formula|Over 9000|Aqua Virtus]". Should [Name] drink it? I mean, we've no idea what it is or where it's been, but somebody obviously put a lot of effort into making it.
#bodyAugment_2 = [FormalName] was poking around an old [square] this morning when [he] stumbled on something odd. Literally. [He] tripped over a loose panel that opened a secret passage leading to a hidden lab.\n\n
#The place looks like some mad scientist's dream home, what with all of the closet-sized computers and mechanical arms. [Name] even found one automated system that looked like it was still working. As far as [he] could tell, it's meant augment its subject with cutting-edge prosthetics. Should [he] try out the strange and untested machine?
#bodyAugment_3 = Seems [FormalName] has found something strange under [CityName's] [square]. It looks like a secret lab of sorts. All the walls are this stark white-paneled affair and there are futuristic-looking crates everywhere.\n\n
#The automated voice that greeted [him] on entry was also a little creepy, what with the way it kept going on about science and baked goods. It's requested the chance to run an experiment on [him]. We're not sure what the experiment entails, but the voice is assuring [him] that [he] will be well rewarded for [his] "purely voluntary" participation.
#bodyAugment_option1 = Experiment with the unknown
#bodyAugment_option2 = Leave the secret lab
#bodyAugment_outcome1_success = [Name] came out that lab a changed [man]. Smarter, stronger, able to fly over buildings in a single leap.... Well, maybe that last part was a bit of an exaggeration.\n\n
#Unfortunately, whatever happened to [him] in there seems to have used up all the lab's resources so [he] is going to be the only one who benefits from it. Still, one person is better than none.
#bodyAugment_outcome1_fail = Whatever happened to [Name] in there did not go well. We're not sure if it was because of the age of the lab equipment, or if the thing was faulty to begin with, but [Name] is not looking healthy after [his] run through the ringer.\n\n
#What's worse is it looks like all of the lab's resources have been used up, so we can't even go back and try to reverse the process.
#bodyAugment_outcome2 = [Name] decided it was best not to play with somebody else's toys. Especially when the owner was probably the sort who cackled at the voices in [*his|her] head.

Outside on the street [he] saw a ragged figure lying in the middle of the street, zombies approaching from all sides. This was bad situation, but [Name] knew exactly what [he] had to do.
measureOfCharacter_2 = [FormalName] went out to investigate some noise near the [square] where [he] was [missioning]. The scene [he] found hit [him] really hard.\n\n
A [group of bandits, wearing matching bandannas and way too much leather|pack of mangy coyotes|collection of zed in bedraggled McNoodles uniforms] had stumbled on a caravan of survivors. They'd been slaughtered... all except a small bundle wrapped in swaddling cloth that the [bandits|drooling animals|minimum wage zombies] were [poking at with stick|sniffing around|picking at].
measureOfCharacter_3 = [FormalName] was out taking a quiet break from [missioning] when [he] heard a commotion inside a nearby house.\n\n
Deciding to take a poke around, he found a [horde of vicious rats|pack of rabid terriers|flock of black ravens] tearing at the remains of a an old sleeping bag. Guessing from the high-pitched cries coming from inside, the [vermin|dogs|birds] had something trapped in there and were trying to make a meal of it.

Unfortunately the "victim" [he] saved turned out to be [*an angry raccoon that hissed and ran off|a headless 'Weeping Amy' doll with a malfunctioning voice circuit|a strange collection of wind-chimes and springs that sounded disturbingly like a fussy baby]. Still, if we ever need to find a brave person to charge into danger, we know who to call.

# gain Coward perk
measureOfCharacter_outcome2 = Some might call [Name] a coward, but I say [he] was just being smart. Sure, [he] may have left an innocent [*man|woman|child] to be mauled to death back there... but at least [he] saved [his] own sorry hide and is still here to tell the story.

# gain Coward perk
measureOfCharacter_outcome3 = It was... pretty gruesome. Well, [he] couldn't actually see much from where [he] was watching, unable to move. But [he] thought there might have been some blood. After a few minutes, the noise eventually stopped.\n\n
A long time later, [Name] crept away in shame.

witnessMiracle_1 = It was [FormalName]'s bad luck to be patrolling the south wall when half a dozen zed breached a weak spot we thought the [*duct tape|chewing gum|packed mud] had sealed off.\n\n
They came at [him] so fast [he] didn't have time to cry for help. It was the crash of the [*sink hole suddenly opening up under the zed, dropping them into a 20 foot pit|nearby tree toppling over, burying the zed in it's branches|nearby building giving way, catching the zed in an avalanche of bricks and broken glass] that saved [him].
witnessMiracle_2 = Disposal detail. The least pleasant part of guard duty; cleaning up the bodies of the undead that pile up against our outer walls. That's what [FormalName] was doing when [he] found [himself] in the path of a [horde of slavering undead|stampede of elk in rut|sea of zombie rats], with no cover to speak of.\n\n
When it looked like all was lost, [*something under the city streets exploded, scattering|a building toppled over, burying|a bus of hopped-up gangsters came flying out one of the alleys, crashing straight into] the [horde|herd|swarm]. The chaos swept past [Name] and left [him] completely unharmed.
witnessMiracle_3 = [FormalName] was [*taking a little siesta from guard duty in an old industrial exhaust pipe|poking around in the sewers to make sure they were sealed off] when [he] was struck with a vision.\n\n
We're talking glowing lights and angelic chorus here. Sounds amazing. I kind of wish the rest of us could have seen it.\n\n
We're not sure how long it lasted, but [Name] was seriously dazed afterwards and couldn't focus on anything for hours.
witnessMiracle_option1 = It must have been a miracle
witnessMiracle_option2 = Try to figure what happened
witnessMiracle_outcome1 = I think that may have been one of those "born again" moments, 'cause we found [Name] on [his] knees, devoutly thanking the almighty for [his] deliverance.\n\n
I guess we've got another church-goer. Not that I'm complaining, of course. It should at least keep [him] out of trouble.
witnessMiracle_outcome1_effect = Gained Devout perk
witnessMiracle_outcome2 = We found [name] still poking around the area trying to figure out some logical explanation behind what happened.\n\n
I suggested maybe there was someone looking out for [him], you know, _up there_... but [he] wasn't buying it.\n\n
Guess [he]'s more the skeptical sort than we gave [him] credit for.
witnessMiracle_outcome2_effect = Gained Skeptic perk


# Thorn in the Paw - The survivor happens upon an animal caught in a trap. Can butcher it for food or let go free. If releases 50% animal frolics off and the survivor gains Animal Lover, 50% chance the discovers they have allergies and gain Allergic to Pets.  Only while hunting?

thornInPaw_1 = I think [FormalName] needs bigger traps. The [*raccoon cub|little duck|young coyote] [he] caught in [his] snare would barely make full meal. Plus, the way it was looking at [him] with those big soulful eyes made [him] feel like a bit of heel.\n\n
Should we let the critter go free?
thornInPaw_2 = [FormalName] was out hunting today when [he] heard the most pitiful cries coming from behind a set of shrubs. Seems [his] trap had caught the leg of a [bear cub|moose calf|wolverine pup] that was calling for help.\n\n
Thankfully the mother didn't seem to be anywhere in sight. Still, there's not going to be much meat on a little thing like that. Should we let it go?
thornInPaw_3 = [FormalName] knew from the sound of the snap that one of [his] traps had a new occupant. Unfortunately, all [he] found inside was a [*skunk kit|snake hatchling|rat pup] that hissed at [him] from its tiny mouth.\n\n
I'm not sure I'd want to eat that, even if there was any real meat on it. Should we let it go?
thornInPaw_option1 = Let it go free
thornInPaw_option2 = Butcher it for food
# 75/25 chance of success (+ animal lover perk)
thornInPaw_outcome1_success = We could have used that meager amount of food, but [Name] is too much of an animal lover. The way that little creature frolicked off like it didn't have a care in the world, I kind of envy it.
thornInPaw_outcome1_success_effect = Gained Animal Lover perk
# + animal allergy perk
thornInPaw_outcome1_fail = After [he] got the little fella out of that bind, [Name] let it have a quick sniff of [his] hand. Awwww... so cute. [His] eyes started to water, but not with emotion. It was a- aah- aaaahlergies. [He] sneezed loudly, making the little creature jump and bolt out of there.\n\n
Seems the critter triggered [Name's] allergies something fierce. Guess we're going to have to try to keep animals away from [him] from now on.
thornInPaw_outcome1_fail_effect = Gained Allergic to Pets perk
# + DifficultyManager.body / 2 food
thornInPaw_outcome2 = You know how it goes: the cuter they look, the better they taste. Sure, it's not a lot of food, but every little bit helps.


# Ostracized Outside - A survivor is briefly unpleasant (bad gas, sinus infection causing them to snore loudly, etc). Can tell them to sleep outside until the issue departs (50% to gain Rebellious, 50% to gain Camper), or can be left inside (general loss of moral).

ostracized_1 = I'm not sure what [he] ate, but [FormalName] has had the worst gas recently. It's like [*a couple zed crawled up his ass and started a cat-fight|a motor-bike run on rotten eggs run through a dorm|skunk's belching every 5 minutes].\n\n
[His] bowels are making it really hard for [his] roommates to get any sleep at all. Do we want to force [him] to stay outside while this works its way through [his] system?
ostracized_2 = You know the expression "Sawing wood?" [FormalName's] snoring's sounds like [he]'s using a [*gas-powered belt-grinder|double-bladed chainsaw|army of asthmatic beavers] to saw [his] logs.\n\n
[He] must have caught a sinus infection or something, and [his] housemates are complaining. Do we force [him] to sleep outside while this thing clears up?
ostracized_3 = I've heard of people talking in their sleep, but [FormalName's] been having full-on debates recently.\n\n
This might be entertaining if it was just an occasional thing, but the repeated midnight arguments [he] about [*custard-flavored hair gel|giant eel fighting|what brand of tea the undead prefer] is making it hard for [his] roommates to get any shut-eye. Do we force [him] to sleep outside for a bit?
ostracized_option1 = Make [him] sleep outside
ostracized_option2 = Tough it out
# roll 75/25 success/fail, on success +camper perk
ostracized_outcome1_success = Turns out [Name] really likes sleeping outside. Can't get enough of it, in fact. I guess if [he]'s going to stay out there permanently, we've got another bed going free.
ostracized_outcome1_success_effect = Gained Camper perk
# 25% chance they gain the stinky perk
ostracized_outcome1_fail = [Name's] unhappy about being forced to sleep outside. As some kind of revenge [he] also stopped showering, and has embraced a kind of pungent wildness. Now [he] smells worse than ever and [his] roommates are no happier than before.
ostracized_outcome1_fail_effect = Gained Stinky perk
# -5% happy because mentionedColin + " is keeping me awake at night"
ostracized_outcome2 = The lack of sleep is going to hurt overall morale for a little while, at least for whoever draws the short straw and has to sleep within a hundred feet of the [guy].\n\n
But [Name] is one of us. Doesn't matter how many of us want to smother [him] with a pillow at 4 in the morning, [he] still has [his] right to a warm bed indoors.

Should [Name] follow him? It might take a while to catch up with him.
stopThief_2 = When [FormalName] went to check out the noises coming from our storage shed, [he] made sure to bring a weapon.\n\n
Turns out what [he] really needed was a good pair of running shoes. [He] interrupted [*an indignant-looking raccoon|an angry escaped monkey|a mangy-looking retriever] that was rummaging through our stuff. It growled at [him] in surprise then bolted through a gap in our wall with {1} in its mouth!\n\n
Should [Name] try to run it down and get our stuff back?
stopThief_3 = A strange child was the last thing [FormalName] expected to find playing in our storage closet, but there she was, [*gap-teeth|backwards baseball cap|snotty nose] and all.\n\n
[Name] tried to talk to the little girl, but she just screamed and ran out, still clasping our {1} tightly in her hands.\n\n
The last [Name] saw of her, the kid was disappearing into [CityName's] dark streets.\n\n

When [he] finally strode back through our gate that evening with {1}, [he] was exhausted and ravenous. Seems the running all over [CityName] really took it out of [him].\n\n
The way [he] was going for third course at dinner, I think the experience may have changed [him], or certainly [his] appetite at least.
stopThief_outcome1_fail_effect = Gained Double Rations perk
# lose item
stopThief_outcome2 = It sucks to lose {1}, but I can't blame [Name] for not going after the thief. Not when they're charging headlong into the zed-filled streets of [CityName].

This place is booby-trapped!\n\n
Should [Name] stay and try to complete the mission? Chances are this isn't the only trap here.
quietTooQuiet_2 = It wasn't so much the [*poorly concealed sniper's nest|shadows of people hidden just around the corner] that told [FormalName] [he] was walking into a trap, as it was the [*incessant giggling|whispered comments of "Closer...

We better be careful what missions we send [him] on from here on out. [His] clumsiness has already got [him] in trouble once.
quietTooQuiet_outcome1_fail_effect = Gained Clumsy perk

Maybe he could use a day off.

I'm sure [Name] wasn't involved, but it sounds like they're looking to deal out some frontier justice unless [he] promises "never to take up arms against [faction] or anyone else, ever again."
riggedTrial_2 = We just got word that [FormalName] has been captured by [faction]. They're putting [him] on trial for, of all things, [*cattle rustling|public indecency|insulting [FactionLeader]].\n\n
It sounds like [he]'s going to get a taste of the lash unless [he] swears some sort of vow of nonviolence.
riggedTrial_3 = [Faction] has arrested [FormalName] and is trying [him] in some sort of kangaroo court. I know [he]'s a little rough around the edges but [he]'d never [*assault one of their engineers|throw zombie heads over their wall|sabotage their water pipes].\n\n
It's a trumped up charge, but they say [he]'s due for a stiff caning unless [he] promises to never pick up a weapon again.
riggedTrial_option1 = Take the punishment
riggedTrial_option2 = Vow to be a pacifist
riggedTrial_option3 = Talk them out of it (respect 75%)
# injured, gains Toughness perk
riggedTrial_outcome1_picture = hospital
riggedTrial_outcome1_pictureColin1 = true 
riggedTrial_outcome1 = [Name] is a tough one, I'll give [him] that. [He] was black and blue by the time [faction] was done with [him], but [he] still strode back into the fort without any help, head held high.\n\n
[He] collapsed not long after and needs a couple days off. We're drawing straws to see who has to be the one to tell [him] that.
riggedTrial_outcome1_effect = Gained Toughness
# gain pacifist perk, +5 respect
riggedTrial_outcome2_picture = [FactionBackground]
riggedTrial_outcome2_pictureColin1 = true 
riggedTrial_outcome2 = [Name] has sworn never again pick up a weapon again and [he] seems to mean it. [He]'ll still do guard duty, but only to warn others of impending danger.\n\n
On the plus side, [Faction] seem really pleased about this and with our attitude of nonviolence. Might just be because they think they're stronger than we are now.
riggedTrial_outcome2_effect = Gained Pacifism perk
# +5 respect, no perk
riggedTrial_outcome3_picture = [FactionBackground]
riggedTrial_outcome3_pictureColin1 = [FactionLeader] 
riggedTrial_outcome3 = [Name] has been let go after a long discussion with [FactionLeader]. It seems they didn't really think [he]'d done it in the first place, but have a policy of publicly punishing someone at least once a month to maintain order.


# Hobby Car - A survivor has found a rusted out vehicle they have fallen in love with.  Wants to spend some time fixing it up (looses survivor for a week). Can encourage them to try to make something practical from the wreck (Gains Driver) or to learn from the experience of putting it back together (Gains Scholar). Either way, vehicle gets busted.
# Name must be eligible for Scholar and Driver perk
hobbyCar_title = Hobby Car
hobbyCar_picture = parking
hobbyCar_pictureColin1 = true 
hobbyCar_1 = I'm not sure what to do with [FormalName]. I found [him] shoving the remains of some old [*hot rod|muscle car|gas guzzler] through the front gate this morning. Seems the thing caught [his] eye and [he]'s determined to try to get it going again.\n\n
I suppose it could be a good learning experience for [him]. Should we give [him] time off to try to get it working? Or ask [him] to take the piece of junk apart and see what makes it tick? Maybe get some useful scrap out of it at least.
hobbyCar_2 = Everyone remembers their first love. Their [*curves|strength|fiery passion]. How [*they lit up the night sky|they moved you]. The way they could [*transport half-a-ton of construction equipment|ford a foot-deep stream without getting a speck of rust on their cab|grip tight to the road, even in the iciest of conditions]...\n\n
Looks like [FormalName] has found [himself] one such love. An [*El Camino|old SUV] that looks like it's seen better days. I don't know if [he]'ll be able to get the thing working, but [he] might learn a thing or two if [he] takes it apart.
hobbyCar_3 = I never took [FormalName] for a car person, but [he]'s had [his] head stuffed into the hood of an old [*Ferrari|Lotus|Tesla] for a couple of days now.\n\n
The thing was hot stuff back in the day, but I don't know how much use it'll be now with the roads so full of zed. That's assuming [he] can even get the thing working. Maybe we should just get [him] to take it apart for scrap.
hobbyCar_option1 = Let [him] fix it
hobbyCar_option2 = Take the car apart
# needs workshop, gain CAR, +10 happiness
hobbyCar_outcome1_success = I can't believe [Name] actually got that hunk of junk running. It made it easier that we had a proper workshop for [him] to use I suppose. [He]'s happy as a clam now in [his] new car.
hobbyCar_outcome1_success_effect = Gained Driver perk
# no workshop, +10 happiness
hobbyCar_outcome1_fail = [Name] got it to run, once, for about two blocks before [*the front axle cracked right in two|engine burst into flames|gas tank fell out of the bottom of the car], taking the rest of the car with it. Too bad we didn't have a proper workshop for [him] to use.\n\n
On the bright side [he] had a great time working on it. That's what really matters.
# gain scholar perk, +3 materials, -10 happiness "I destroyed a beautiful car in the name of science"
hobbyCar_outcome2 = [Name] was sad to pull [his] beauty to pieces, but [he] really got in to the experience, learning as much as [he] could about every piece [he] dismantled.\n\n
[He] even [*started to write a book about the experience|put together a presentation describing the process]. We may just have a scholar on our hands here.
hobbyCar_outcome2_effect = Gained Scholar perk


# Bad Dreams - Survivor is having trouble sleeping. Can either leave them alone (Gains Light Sleeper) or try to give them something for the problem (Gains Eccentric).
# Name eligible for light sleeper and eccentric perks
badDreams_title = Bad Dreams
badDreams_picture = bedroom
badDreams_pictureColin1 = true 
badDreams_1 = [FormalName] has always suffered from insomnia, and it's been especially bad lately. Though, to be fair, that whole affair with the zombie hiding [under [his] bed|in [his] closet] probably didn't help.\n\n
My granny taught me an old herbal remedy we could try. Sure, it [*also used to made her giggle uncontrollably|might have been what finally killed her|was also her solution for cleaning blocked drains], but at this point I'm not it could make things worse.
badDreams_2 = This is the fifth night in a row [FormalName] has woken up screaming at the top of [his] lungs. Aside from waking everyone else up, [he]'s going to [*bring the zombies down on our heads|destroy [his] vocal cords|crack the window pane] if [he] keeps this up.\n\n
I read an article once about a relaxation tonic made from [snake mucus|duck tears|rabbit's toenails]. I admit, I'm not sure about the author's credentials, but the placebo effect might help. Just tell [him] [snakes|ducks|rabbits] don't have nightmares.
badDreams_3 = I woke up early this morning to find [FormalName] [*playing connect the dots on [his] ceiling tiles|carving snowmen out of bars of homemade soap|talking to the mold growing on the walls of [his] room]. I think this is the fourth night [he]'s gone without sleep.\n\n
It's not healthy, and [he] could hurt someone if [he]'s too sleep deprived to shoot straight. I know an old First Nations remedy I could whip up that's supposed to help you sleep. I'm just not sure of the side effects...
badDreams_option1 = Give [him] the tonic
# grey out if you have less than 2 medicine
badDreams_option2 = Use real prescription (-2 medicine)
badDreams_option3 = Do nothing
# add eccentric perk and +10 happiness "I loves me tonic"
badDreams_outcome1 = Well, the concoction got [him] to sleep, but [he]'s been acting a little weird since. Not the creepy "[*I'm going to stab you in your sleep|watch you in the shower|sit and stare at you]" sort of weird. More... the "[*climbing onto the rooftops and cawing like a rooster every morning|organizing all of the forts cutlery by weight|picking the fourth leaf off of every sunflower]" sort of weird.\n\n
Eccentric, but happy.
badDreams_outcome1_effect = Gained Eccentric perk
# lose -2 medicine
badDreams_outcome2 = Better to go with actual scientifically tested medicine than some weird home remedy. Unfortunately some of these pills are expired, so they've probably lost some potency. I didn't tell [Name] that though; I figure it's better than nothing.\n\n
Looks like they worked. [He]'s sleeping much better now that [he]'s taking them.
# gain Light Sleeper perk and -10 happiness "I can't sleep at night"
badDreams_outcome3 = [Name] still isn't sleeping, but at least [he]'s learned to sleep lightly and not to wake the rest of us up anymore. Having another light sleeper to keep watch at night never hurts.
badDreams_outcome3_effect = Gained Light Sleeper perk

# Quack - Requires injured survivor. A traveling vendor of suspicious concoctions shows up saying he/she can cure whatever ails you. Can give them food to cure one of your injured. That survivor gains either Stinky (50%) or Fast Recovery (50%).
# name must be eligible for stinky and fast recovery
# {1} - cost of cure
#quackDoctor_title = Quack
#quackDoctor_1 = This colorful 'Doctor' showed up at our fort today. Music was blaring from [his|her] old-fashioned [*gramophone record|boombox|MP3 player] as [he|she] tried to convince us that [his|her] amazing [*snake oil|acai berry|sea-slug] concoction could cure all our ills, from [*athlete's foot|gout|rickets] to [*broken limbs|rabies|concussions].\n\n
#I don't trust the stuff, but [FormalName] is willing to give it a go, and [he]'s the one who could most use it right now. Do we want to pay the Doc {1} to fix up [Name]?
#quackDoctor_2 = A slimy salesman pulled to the fort today. [She|he]'s trying to convince us to buy some of [her|his] magical cure-all. [She|he] says it's made from all-natural ingredients. I've already pointed out to [her|him] that [*poison ivy|arsenic|rat shit] is all natural, but [she|he]'s having none of it.\n\n
#Still, [FormalName] hasn't been looking too good recently. Do we want to pay this 'Doctor' to try and help [Name]?
#quackDoctor_3 = Some stranger burst into our sick ward today and started poking our people with a stick, claiming [he|she] was there to 'examine' our injured. I was just about to start with the '[*Who the hell are you|How the hell did you get in our fort|Where did you come from]?' questions when stopped in front of [FormalName] with a cry of 'Ah HA!'\n\n
#'I've zeen a case like zis before. Very serious. Still a quick dose of my patented _[*Vita-Juice|Aloe Star|Pep Pills]_ and [he] will be all cured. Iz very good deal. Just {1}.'
#quackDoctor_option1 = Pay the doctor {1}
#quackDoctor_option2 = Tell the 'Doctor' to get lost
#quackDoctor_outcome1_success = Wow, that stuff actually worked. [Name] is right as rain and [he] seems to have more energy than ever. I've never seen someone heal that fast.\n\n
#I would have liked to have thanked the strange little doctor properly, but they were long gone by the time I went looking.
#quackDoctor_outcome1_fail = I'm glad [Name] is feeling better, but I could have wished that concoction hadn't made [him] smell like [*a bucket of wet ferrets|week-old roadkill|outflow of a waste treatment plant]. I guess we'll all just have to get used to it.\n\n
#I would have liked to have thanked the stranger 'properly', but of course they were long gone by the time I went looking.
#quackDoctor_outcome2 = We told the huckster to get lost. Our people can get better [*the way God intended, with plenty of screaming, blood and pus|like everyone else, through the application of a good dose of leeches|on their own time. I'm sure the zed will wait].


# Those Who Can't, Teach - An expert in fighting/scavenging/building/engineering/leadership stops by and takes a shine to one of your survivors. Can pay them resources (X food/medicine/ammo) to learn one of the three perks for that discipline. Probably should be one of the standing missions so the player can choose the survivor who should get the skill.

expertTeacher_1 = Gustav brought [an elderly woman in a wheelchair|a very fragile looking old lady|a tough and sun-wrinkled woman in her 80's] by today with his caravan. She was a little hard to understand with her [*having no teeth|muttering all the time|thick accent] but Gustav says she's a master {1} and looking to sell her training skills.\n\n
_"Ees worth any price"_ he says, but her price is indeed high: {2}. She's picked out three survivors who she says are eligible.
expertTeacher_2 = You know how in fantasy stories there's always some [wizard|sage|witch|crone] that's looking to pass on esoteric life advice to the hero? Well we've met the perfect modern day example of that today.\n\n
Gustav brought the elderly {1} by with his caravan, and set her up in a house nearby. She identified three of our survivors who she'd be willing to teach, but it's going to cost us {2}.
expertTeacher_3 = Gustav introduced us to an elderly woman today who claims to be a master {1}. She's certainly frail enough that you've got to wonder how she survived so long.\n\n
_"Dis woman,"_ said Gustav, getting into salesman mode, _"she livink for two years alone, no problem. She only come when I tell her she can be rich woman."_\n\n
Rich indeed; she wants {2} in exchange for training one of our survivors. She's very particular with who she'll teach.
expertTeacher_option1 = Teach [FormalName]
expertTeacher_option2 = Teach [FormalName2]
expertTeacher_option3 = Teach {3}

expertTeacher_teach_effect = +1 level and gained {2} perk
# -5 respect
expertTeacher_outcome2 = I told Gustav this is the kind of classicism we'd like to eradicate, where knowledge is only available to those who can afford higher education. Knowledge should be free.\n\n
He and the {1} didn't seem to agree, and Gustav was particularly annoyed at us. I'm guessing he was supposed to get a hefty cut of the woman's fee too.

# after trade mission with a faction that the negotiator's on
# results in some extra resources and/or food
#perkNegotiator_title = Trade Bonus
#perkNegotiator_picture = [factionBackground]
#perkNegotiator_1 = [Faction] threw in a little extra {1} while trading with [Name]. I guess the [guy]'s got bartering in [his] blood, they can't resist that salesman charm.
#perkNegotiator_2 = I've never seen such a salesman as [FormalName]. The [man]'s a natural you know, [he] could sell life insurance to a zombie.\n\n
#Today [he] got [faction] to throw in a bunch of extra {1} to a trade deal. Not bad [Name]!
#perkNegotiator_3 = I hadn't expected [Name] to come back from [his] trade mission with so much stuff, but it sounds like [his] [rude limericks|patented monkey dance|bright eyes and winning smile] was so much a hit with [faction] that they threw in some extra {1} as part of the deal!


# during preach mission that a preacher is on
# results in big happiness + the devout trait in someone
perkPreacher_title = Preach it [Brother]
perkPreacher_picture = street
perkPreacher_1 = [FormalName's] been proselytizing up a storm at that little church. [Name2] heard the good word and has become a devout follower.
perkPreacher_2 = I've never held too much with religious stuff myself, but I understand that people need something to believe in, and [FormalName's] doing a fine job of getting people believin' from that pulpit of [hiss].\n\n
[Name2's] even come round to [his] way of thinkin' and has been helping out round the church. Cleaning pews, polishing windows, and making sure the vestry is properly stocked with armaments should the dead come a-callin'.
perkPreacher_3 = I always thought that [FormalName] was the quiet sort, but you put [him] in a church and [he] starts speaking with the fiery passion that well and true inspires others.\n\n
[Name2] one of the latest [he]'s inspired and, I have to say, is doing a lot better for it. Leastwise we haven't caught [him2] [crying in bathroom|screaming at the seagulls|scratching those weird signs in the walls] for almost a week now.


# during 3+ person mission that the entertainer's on
# happiness boost for the other survivors
perkEntertainer_title = That's Entertainment
perkEntertainer_picture = pawnshop
perkEntertainer_1 = [FormalName] brought a guitar along while we were [missioning] at the [square]. It didn't seem appropriate at first, but then we got into it. Before we knew it we were all singing along to [Sweet Home Alabama|American Pie|Hotel California|Home For A Rest].\n\n
God I hate that song.
perkEntertainer_2 = It was all we could do to keep things together when the undead showed up while we were out [missioning] at the square. I probably would have lost it if hadn't been for [FormalName's] wisecracks.\n\n
Watching [him] call the creatures names, crack jokes, and generally make a fool of [himself] as we gunned the zed down almost makes the zombie killing business fun.
perkEntertainer_3 = Given how edgy everyone's been, I've been avoiding [FormalName] what with [his] habit of yappin' away to everyone and I got to say, that was probably a mistake.\n\n
[Name] was out with us [missioning] the other day and got us all talkin' about near everything. Our hopes, our dreams, even [what color of picket fence we'd have around our dream home|which flavor ice cream we think would work best on pizza|where we were when we met our first zed].\n\n
I gotta say, we came back from the [square] feelin' a whole sight better than when we left.


# during scavenging missions the hoarder is on
# bonus building materials
perkHoarder_title = Bonus Scavenged Materials
perkHoarder_picture = pawnshop
perkHoarder_1 = I admit I doubted [Name's] compulsive hoarding would ever be useful, but [his] eye for junk that any sane person would overlook has paid off again.
perkHoarder_2 = Being a pack rat has its uses. Not only does [Name] usually have whatever it is you need on hand, the extra stuff [he] finds when out scavenging is nothing short of amazing.\n\n
I just wish [he]'d let us clear all those [stale beer bottles|little horse dolls|soldier's helmets] out of [his] room. You can't see the floor and its starting to smell in there.
perkHoarder_3 = [Name's] obsessive compulsion saves the day again! Leastwise [he] wouldn't leave the area until [he]'d dug through every [dumpster|porta-potty|plastic shopping bag] [he] could find. And we ended up with extra supplies out of it, so I can't really complain.


# any time
# skip eating for one day (looks like bonus food)
perkGoodCook_title = Good Cook
perkGoodCook_picture = food
perkGoodCook_1 = They say hunger is the best spice, but I think [cumin|black pepper]'s a close second. For lunch [FormalName] whipped us up a stew so succulent you almost couldn't tell it had no meat in it. I'm happy to be vegetarian with this [guy] in the fort.\n\n
I'm so stuffed now I can barely move, I'm skipping dinner.
perkGoodCook_2 = [FormalName] really knows [his] way around a kitchen. Tonight [he] turned some [canned peas|saltine crackers|sprouted potatoes|expired mayo] and [ketchup|weeds|spam|cough medicine|Kraft dinner] into a serious feast. The [guy]'s a magician.\n\n
I feel like I won't need to eat again for a week.
perkGoodCook_3 = I'm not sure how [Name] managed to turn those couple of [squirrels|raccoons|seagulls] [he] caught into a meal fit to feed the whole fort, but I ain't complaining about the results.\n\n
Don't mind me. I'm just gonna slip into a food coma now. Wake me tomorrow.


# during farming missions
# bonus food
perkGreenThumb_title = Green Thumb
perkGreenThumb_picture = farm
perkGreenThumb_1 = The bigger grocery store tomatoes used to get, the more watery they tasted. Well, [Name's] found some way to grow gigantic tomatoes with all the flavor of a little cherry one. If you don't let the color throw you off... [he] says black is perfectly normal for some varieties.
perkGreenThumb_2 = [FormalName] won't tell me [his] farming secret, but the [guy]'s been sticking [his] green thumb into everything and making it grow like mad. I think that [he] secretly sings to them... but I can't prove it.
perkGreenThumb_3 = The way [FormalName] spends all day out in the field, you'd almost think the [guy] is a plant [himself], but there's no denying the results. [He]'s got [corn coming out the ears|a head for lettuce|an eye for potatoes].


# any time
# replace a useless building with a useful one
perkRedecorator_title = Redecorator
perkRedecorator_picture = street
perkRedecorator_1 = Somebody turned an old {1} into a brand new [square] last night. Yes, overnight.\n\n
[Name] won't admit it was [him], but [he] keeps asking everybody what we think of the new building. Personally, I like the old color scheme better, but this [square] should be more useful.
perkRedecorator_2 = When [Name] said we could make better use of the old {1}, I just blew [him] off, but [he] was determined to prove me wrong. [He] spent almost every night in there for the past week and when we got up this morning the place had been turned into a brand new [square].\n\n
I'm not sure how [he] did that all [himself], but there's no denying it, the [boy]'s got talent.
perkRedecorator_3 = I kind of liked the old {1}. We had one just like it back when I was a kid. But even I've got to admit, we weren't getting a lot of use out of that thing.\n\n
Seems [Name] felt that way too. [He]'s been working on cleaning the place up in [his] spare time and has managed to turn it into a fully-functional [square].


# when ending a fortifying mission
# happiness boost
perkArtist_title = Beautiful Walls
perkArtist_picture = gate
perkArtist_1 = We all had to take a break today to admire the new wall [FormalName] just put up around the [square]. It's breathtaking... I've never seen something with such a balance of form and function. It's sturdy and utilitarian, yet seems to move with a fluid beauty.\n\n
[That wrecked car chassis on the one end nearly brought tears to my eyes.|The set of pink plastic flamingos give it that extra touch of class.|We would put it in a gallery if it wasn't busy keeping the zombies out.]
perkArtist_2 = [FormalName] found a cache of spray paint and went to town on the new wall around the [square]. [He] painted a massive mural in a glorious communist-propaganda style, to commemorate the rebuilding of [CityName].\n\n
It's a shame the zombies will probably tear it down before the year's out, but that just adds an edge of impermanence to [his] work.
perkArtist_3 = I've never seen [paper mache|a kids playground|blackberry brambles] used that way before, but I've got to say the way [FormalName] has incorporated into the wall surrounding our [square] is stunning.\n\n
The whole structure almost looks as if it was alive... though that may just be the zed [he] trapped in there while [he] was working.


# when someone would have been killed on a mission but the firstAid was there
# Name is the firstaider, Name2 saved from death and is injured instead
perkFirstAid_title = Saved by First Aid
perkFirstAid_picture = hospital
perkFirstAid_1 = [FormalName's] medical training really saved [Name2's] hide today. [He2] should have been a goner for sure with a hole that big in [his2] gut. [Name] had to stuff all sorts of nasty things back in there before [he] sewed it up.\n\n
[Name2] will still need a few days to recover, but that's a lot better than being dead. Considering the danger, I'd say [he2] was damn lucky.
perkFirstAid_2 = Did you know when someone is unexpectedly impaled, you're not supposed to remove the [pitchfork|broken signpost|rusty piece of rebar] until you're sure you've got a way to stop the bleeding?\n\n
Luckily [FormalName] has experience with this sort of thing. With [his] help and a few days' bedrest, [Name2] looks like [he2] is going to pull through.\n\n
[Name's] miffed that we sent the two of them into such a dangerous situation in the first place. But it's a good thing [he] was there... I probably would have yanked the thing out, like taking out a splinter.
perkFirstAid_3 = [FormalName] should have been a tailor the way [he] stitched up [Name2's] wound out in the field like that. We better make sure to send [him] along on any other dangerous missions. I don't even think [he2]'s going have a scar once [he2]'s had a few days to heal.\n\n
I wonder if [Name] would be able to help me with my [spare pair of underwear|old pair of lime green socks|pair of signature post-apocalyptic leather pants]. They've never been the same since I tore that hole in them.


# during research mission
# research finishes early
perkBookworm_title = Bookworm Research Boost
perkBookworm_picture = tech
perkBookworm_1 = [Name's] had [his] nose in one book or another since [he] started researching {1}. We thought [he] was just avoiding work, but [he] ran into the lab today yelling "Eureka!" and grinning ear to ear. I think [he]'s always wanted to do that.\n\n
Anyway [his] books had the answer we were looking for and we've figured this {1} thing out early.
perkBookworm_2 = You know, I've been getting real sick of dragging books back to the fort for [Name]. \n\n
Every time we find ourselves in a school or a library it's "Could you carry this, the print almost legible" or "I've always wanted a complete set of '[Encyclopedia Americana|Science Now!|The Magic Boarding School for Juvenile Delinquents]'."\n\n
Still, it may have just paid off. When we wanted to research {1}, [he] ran off to [his] bookshelves and came back with the perfect reference text for it. Having that thing on hand cut out hours of man-work.
perkBookworm_3 = [FormalName] absorbs writing. Whenever [he] passes any piece of text, be it a book, a sign, or even just [a government paint requisition form|someone's diary|the meeting minutes from a long dead strata organization] that's been left on a desk somewhere, [he]'s got to stop and read it.\n\n
While it's made for a few close calls with the zed, it does mean that [he]'s a never ending fountain of obscure bits of trivia. And he had just the info we were looking for when it came to the {1} we've been researching recently. With [his] help we were able to finish up the project in record time.


# when workshop mission completes
# bonus items
# {1} item created in workshop
perkCrafter_title = Crafter Bonus Items
perkCrafter_picture = food
perkCrafter_1 = [FormalName] produced more {1} than we were expecting, while mysteriously using the same number of parts. [He] says when [he] can't sleep, it soothes [him] to make things, and it helps to pass the time in those terrible endless hours between midnight and dawn.
perkCrafter_2 = You remember that old story of the shoe maker who had a bunch of gnomes creep into his shop every night to secretly make shoes for him? I'm sure [FormalName] has one of those gnomes. There's no way [he] could have put together extra {1} without help.\n\n
[He] denies it of course, but I know better. Give me time, I'll prove that [he]'s a gnome lover, make no mistake.
perkCrafter_3 = [FormalName] is always saying "Work smarter, not harder". I felt sure [he]'s just parroting some of those old Sunday-morning motivational cartoons, but there may be something to what [he] says.\n\n
[He]'s managed to put together more {1} than the rest of us could have managed in the same amount of time, and [he] doesn't even look winded.


# makes 1-5 other people on the same mission unhappy
perkDowner_title = A Real Downer
perkDowner_picture = street
perkDowner_pictureColin = true
perkDowner_1 = I hate to say it, but [Name] can be a real Eeyore sometimes. Today we were out [missioning], and just chatting about our favorite old movies and TV shows and stuff. And every time [Name's] like: "Bill Murray? He's dead. Ellen Page? She'll never make another movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman? At least he wasn't around to get eaten by zombies like the rest of them. Lucky bastard."\n\n
Thinking about all those movies that will never be made now really bummed us out.
perkDowner_2 = We were [missioning] today out at [a] [square], and out of nowhere [Name] suddenly sat down and refused to work. [He] said [he] was "feeling down". I tried to tell [him] we all feel like that and you just gotta keep going. But [he] just kept saying "what's the point" and "why bother, we'll probably be dead tomorrow" until I just gave up and sat there beside [him].\n\n
I dunno, maybe [he]'s right.
perkDowner_3 = That [Name] is such a buzzkill, you know? We were out [missioning], and I'm trying to take joy in the little things, like I found this funny pink cowboy hat and I'm dancing around wearing it and doing a funny voice. But [Name] says "The person who owned that hat is dead you know." and told me I should have more respect.\n\n
I'm seriously just trying to keep from going crazy myself, okay? I just wish [Name] didn't always bring the rest of us down like that.

perkRebellious_title = Take this job and shove it
perkRebellious_picture = breakdown
perkRebellious_1 = [FormalName's] refusing to work today. [He]'s supposed to be [missioning], but says [he] can't on account of today being an observation of worker's rights in some country or other. I think [he] just made that up to annoy me, and it's working.\n\n
From the sound of it this "worker's rights" holiday is going to last a few days for [Name]. Not sure what [his] problem us with authority, but it's causing trouble for the rest of us.
perkRebellious_2 = [FormalName's] refusing to do the job we assigned to [him]. Says that [missioning] isn't fun at all, and that [he] isn't getting enough say in controlling [his] own destiny. That we're stifling [his] "creative freedom".\n\n
If [he] keeps this up, just wait until the zed coming a-knocking. Our guards may choose to exercise their own "creative freedom" and [he] can fend off the zombies by [himself].
perkRebellious_3 = I caught [Name] goofing off today. [He] was supposed to be out [missioning] but [he] blew it off, muttering some crap about [his] horoscope telling [him] not to.\n\n
I tried to get [him] back out there but [he] accused me of trying to persecute [him] for [his] religious beliefs.\n\n
This is BS, he's just making this up to get out of work! I've never heard of the "12 Starred House of the Moon Rabbit", and I seriously doubt [he] believes the stars control the movements of the zed.

perkDriver_title = Fast Driver
perkDriver_picture = street
perkDriver_1 = [Name's] {1} is so fast, [he] finished [missioning] in half the time today. That [guy] has some serious driving skills. The zombies didn't even have time to get excited, [he] was in and out of that [square] so fast.
perkDriver_2 = That [guy] [Name] says [he] watched every Fast & Furious movie at least five times. Until today I couldn't imagine why you would subject yourself to such torture, but I guess [he] learned some tricks from those movies.\n\n
[He] finished [missioning] so fast today it made my head spin.



# at random times, bath salts addicts may refuse to work if you run out

# or get free drugs from pharmacists
# or instant rehab with drugs, or for free with doctor main leader job
perkAddict_title = Bath Salts Addiction
perkAddict_picture = bedroom
perkAddict_1 = [Name] seems to be hooked on those Bath Salts we've been getting from the Pharmacists. We never noticed it before because [he]'s such a high functioning addict, always showing up to work on time, almost obnoxiously cheery and energetic.\n\n
But now that we've run out of the stuff, it's a different story. [He]'s pale and shaky, jumping at the slightest sound. Horrible night terrors keep [him] from sleeping and [he] can barely get out of bed in the morning.\n\n
What should we do?
perkAddict_option1 = Go cold turkey
perkAddict_option2 = Call our dealers (need 75 respect)
perkAddict_option3 = Rehab treatment (costs 10 medicine)
perkAddict_option4 = Rehab treatment (Doctor profession)
# 50/50 chance of losing the addiction perk
perkAddict_outcome1Success = I told [Name] to take as much time and bedrest as [he] needs to get through this. We'll bring [him] chicken soup (or the closest we can manage) and walk on eggshells around [him] until then.\n\n
[He] seems determined to kick this addiction to bath salts and is already showing progress.
perkAddict_outcome1Fail = I told [Name] to take as much time and bedrest as [he] needs to get through this. We'll bring [him] chicken soup (or the closest we can manage) and walk on eggshells around [him] until then.\n\n
But to be honest, I'm not sure [he]'s got the willpower to beat this thing. [He] threw the last bowl of soup in my face, saying if I really wanted [him] to feel better, I'd bring [him] some damn bath salts.
perkAddict_outcome2_pictureColin = [FactionLeader]
perkAddict_outcome2 = The Pharmacists came to our rescue, giving us 10 doses of Bath Salts on the house. "Everybody reacts differently to withdrawal," Tiff explained as she prepared a dose for [Name]. "Some have no symptoms at all. You think _[he]'s_ bad, you should see me without my morning coffee."\n\n
Wait, the Pharmacists have _coffee_ over there? We might be buying the wrong drug from them...
perkAddict_outcome3 = We pumped [Name] full of strong painkillers, and though [he]'s a bit woozy [he] should be able to work in this state. A few days on these babies and [he]'ll forget [he] was ever hooked on Bath Salts. Getting [him] off the painkillers will be a hurdle for another day.
perkAddict_outcome4 = We pumped [Name] full of strong painkillers, and though [he]'s a bit woozy [he] should be able to work in this state. A few days on these babies and [he]'ll forget [he] was ever hooked on Bath Salts. Getting [him] off the painkillers will be a hurdle for another day.

perkAddictSteal_title = Missing Bath Salts
perkAddictSteal_picture = survival
perkAddictSteal_1 = Someone's been stealing Bath Salts from our supplies. I can't prove who it might have been, but I've got my eye on [Name]. Like the others, [he]'s been using them regularly on dangerous missions, to calm the nerves and keep [him] alert out there. But [he] came to me after hours last week asking for an extra dose "to help [him] get to sleep".\n\n
I reminded everyone that nobody should be taking Bath Salts unless they actually need them, and [moved the stash to a different location|put a lock on the box we keep them in].

perkAddictHero_1 = I should be dead. I got pinned down by one of them, its putrid death-breath in my face and dripping infected spittle. While I desperately tried to wrestle it away, two others nearly twisted my feet off trying to get through my reinforced boots. It was beyond bad.\n\n
Until suddenly [Name] tore them off me with [his] bare hands. [He] drove [his] fist through one rotted skull, then threw another across the room. [He] was in some kind of frenzy, his eyes wide and bloodshot, looking like one of the undead themselves. He says he had no idea [he] could be so strong, until [he] started taking those Bath Salts. Now [he] swears by them, and won't go on a mission without a noseful of those crystals. I'm alive today because of it.

# Cannibalism
######################################

# Stray Dog BBQ - Optionally eat a dog, only available if you're close to starving. Opens up other cannibalism events.
# Name = person cutting up dog meat or shooting the dog
cannibalStray_title = Fragrant Meat
cannibalStray_picture = dogsAttack
cannibalStray_1 = This morning [Name] shot a stray dog that got into our food stores somehow. Damn thing ate [all the saltines|the last of the digestive cookies|that moldy salami I'd been saving].\n\n
You know, I've heard dogs are a delicacy in China, and we are short on supplies - should we eat the dog?
cannibalStray_2 = A stray mutt broke into one of our houses and almost took [Name's] hand off before [he] caved the dog's skull in with [a shovel|a chair leg|a candlestick|a fireplace poker]. It's a shame, three years ago these dogs were somebody's pet, but now they're feral as wolves in the desperation to survive.\n\n
We're awfully short of meat and it's a decent sized dog. Should we eat the stray?
cannibalStray_3 = A feral dog broke into our canteen last night and was attacking anyone who went into get their coffee this morning. Well, we call it coffee, but it's probably more mud than beans at this point.\n\n
We were forced to shoot the thing in the end. Of course, now we find ourselves with 20 pounds of fresh meat that could full plenty of empty bellies. Do we want to eat the dog?
cannibalStray_option1 = Eat the dog
cannibalStray_option2 = Bury the dog
cannibalStray_outcome1_1 = [Name] got [his] knives out and chopped us up some meat. [He] sliced it into thin strips and hung it out to dry into jerky. Hopefully it'll be harder to identify that way and will taste just like any other meat.
cannibalStray_outcome1_2 = I don't think that was the healthiest beast and the meat was a little gamey, but at least we'll have still have the strength to stand come tomorrow.
cannibalStray_outcome2_1 = We buried the dog. When spring comes the body will help fertilize our tomatoes and string beans. That is if we make it that long.
cannibalStray_outcome2_2 = We through the dog in a pit and covered it with dirt. Part of me thinks it's a shame to waste the meat, but the little guy reminded me too much of [Mr.Fluffles|Samuel|Jackson Pollock], my old retriever.


# Dog Died - happens spontaneously as a negative event, but pretend they died saving their owner
cannibalDog_title = {1} Died
cannibalDog_picture = grave
cannibalDog_1 = [Name's] dog {1} saved [his] life today while they were out [missioning]. Some zed came shuffling around the corner behind [him], in that eerily quiet way they walk when they've lost their shoes. {1} jumped into action, barking and leading the zed away from [his] master. But there were too many. By the time [Name] killed them all, {1} was gone.
cannibalDog_2 = I wonder what this city must smell like to a dog. Their noses are thousands of times more sensitive than ours; does that mean they can smell each individual composing body out there?\n\n
That canine sense of smell has saved us many times, but today {1} went one step further and jumped between his master and a zombie. He was loyal to the end.
# added to the mix only if cannibalism is an option
cannibalDogEat_1 = [Name] would have been a goner if it wasn't for that dog {1}, who died valiantly defending [him] today. Now we've got a decision to make though... food is a serious issue these days, and the meat on this dog could be the difference between life and death for us.\n\n
Do we eat it?
cannibalDogEat_2 = [Name] is lucky just to be alive after this morning's fiasco at the [square]... let's just say [he] wasn't paying attention and leave it at that. Unfortunately [his] dog {1} didn't make it through the ordeal.\n\n
I hear dog meat doesn't taste too bad, kind of like mutton. Having more protein in our diets might make us more clear headed, so mistakes like this one won't happen again. Should we eat it?
cannibalDog_option1 = Bury {1}
cannibalDog_option2 = Eat the dog's body
cannibalDog_outcome1_1 = We had a proper burial for {1}. We respect those who give their lives to help rebuild this city, human or otherwise.
cannibalDog_outcome1_2 = We buried {1} along with our own fallen. We aren't so far gone from civilization yet that we'll stoop to eating loyal pets.
cannibalDog_outcome2_1 = We said a few words, then cooked and ate poor {1}. I'm not saying I don't feel bad about it, but a dog is a dog and we have to eat.
cannibalDog_outcome2_2 = {1} was a loyal companion. Everybody was a little sad we had to eat him, but he was just a dog after all.



# Somebody dies in some way. Shown directly after the event explaining how they died. All we
# know is their body is edible. Reporter is main leader.
cannibalEatDead_title = Eat the Dead
cannibalEatDead_picture = grave
cannibalEatDead_1 = [Name] was a good [man], and we're all going to miss [him]. Life would be less hard if we didn't have to mourn with empty bellies though. Should we add [his] body to our food supply?
cannibalEatDead_2 = We managed to recover [FormalName's] body intact. Which means we will have a proper funeral for [him]... but we don't need to bury the _whole_ body. It'd be a shame to waste that meat. Should we eat [Name]?
cannibalEatDead_3 = [FormalName] has died. [His] last words were "Please, let me return to the earth." I know [he] was asking to be buried, but we shouldn't let [his] death be for nothing. I mean, [he]'ll return to the earth eventually, [he]'ll just be taking the scenic route.\n\n
Should we eat [his] body?
cannibalEatDead_4 = Now that [FormalName] has finally kicked the bucket, shuffled off [his] mortal coil and joined the choir invisible, we have the question of what to do with [his] remains.\n\n
Do we want [his] body pushing up daises in the park, or shall we add it to our food stores so [he] can fill our bellies?
cannibalEatDead_5 = [FormalName's] death is a tragedy. [He] was a generous [man], and we'll all remember [his] small kindnesses that made life just a little better.\n\n
There's one more way [he] can improve our lives, even in death: we have the option of adding [his] body to our food stores. We never really talked about it, but I think it's what [he] would have wanted.
cannibalEatDead_6 = With [FormalName's] last breath, he pleaded with us not to eat [him]. "Not like the others," he begged. To comfort [him] we promised it would never happen... but now that [he]'s gone, [he]'ll never know...
cannibalEatDead_7 = Sadly [FormalName] is dead. I know if it was me, I would want the rest of the fort to have my belongings if it helped them to survive. I guess that would include my body, which could feed someone for weeks if it came to that.
# dead guy had the devout trait and really didn't want to be eaten
cannibalEatDeadDevout_1 = In life, [FormalName] was a very devout [man]. [He] was always trying to steer us on the right moral path. Though [he] and I had our differences and didn't always see eye to eye, I tried to respect [his] wishes.\n\n
The thing is, [he]'s dead now... and [his] body is just dead meat. Edible dead meat. Maybe even delicious dead meat if we prepare it right. Should we eat [him]?
cannibalEatDeadDevout_2 = Sadly [FormalName] is gone, but we managed to recover [his] body. [He] was a religious [man] and would want a proper burial, but the decision should be up to us, the living.\n\n
The thing is, we living need food. And though [Name] would have hated even considering this, we could add [his] body to our larder. Should we eat [him]?
cannibalEatDeadDevout_3 = [FormalName] turned to religion during the last years of [his] life, and was always lecturing us on our poor moral choices. One thing that particularly disgusted [him] was the thought of eating another human being. [He] forbade us from eating [his] body if [he] ever died, no matter how desperate and starving we were.\n\n
Well, now [Name's] dead, we're hungry, and guess what: [he] isn't here to stop us anymore. Should we respect [his] wishes, or eat [his] body?
# some people want to be eaten
cannibalEatDeadEatMe_1 = Before [he] died, [FormalName] had a brief moment of clarity through all the pain and delirium. [He] asked us to eat [him], so that we could survive.\n\n
We do need the food... but I used to play poker with the [guy]! We can't eat our friend... can we?
cannibalEatDeadEatMe_2 = [FormalName] died shortly after we got [him] back to the fort, but before that kept repeating "Eat me, eat my body".\n\n
Starvation is always around the corner in [CityName]... but has it come to this?
cannibalEatDeadEatMe_3 = [FormalName's] last request before [he] died was that we put [his] body to use and eat it. "It's just a shell," [he] said, "I don't need it anymore. Happy Birthday."\n\n
I'm not sure if the birthday reference was a joke or just delirium talking, but we have to decide if we should do what [he] asked us to. Should we eat [him]?
cannibalEatDeadEatMe_4 = When it was obvious that [FormalName] wasn't going to make it, [he] said [his] last wish was that we eat [his] body. The loss of blood must have put [him] in a joking mood, because [he] started listing off recipes for human & potato stew, human & apple sausage, human meatloaf...\n\n
Until with one last chuckle [he] closed [his] eyes for the last time.
cannibalEatDead_option1 = Bury [his] remains
cannibalEatDead_option2 = Eat [his] remains
cannibalEatDead_outcome1_1 = How shameful that we even considered the idea. We may be hungry, but keeping our humanity is more important than mere survival.
cannibalEatDead_outcome1_2 = Of course we didn't eat [Name]. The ground's too hard to dig a proper grave, but we laid [him] to rest best we could.
cannibalEatDead_outcome1_3 = My heart feels better for putting [him] to rest properly, but my stomach is starting to eat itself. Is that really any different than what we were thinking?
cannibalEatDead_outcome1_4 = We honored [Name] with a funeral pyre, and if the smell of cooking meat wafted by our noses at any point, nobody said a thing."
cannibalEatDead_outcome2_1 = It's not the way I wanted to say goodbye to [Name], but at least the rest of us will be able to keep going long enough to see a few more days.
cannibalEatDead_outcome2_2 = Survival is what matters here, and [Name] was given one last opportunity to help us survive after death. We are very grateful for this.
cannibalEatDead_outcome2_3 = [Name] didn't taste as bad as I was expecting. But I'll tell you what, you people aren't eating me when I die, that's for sure.
cannibalEatDead_outcome2_4 = It's not so bad if you don't think about it. We cooked the meat up into a stew with what little vegetables we had left, and really you could hardly tell.
cannibalEatDead_outcome2_5 = You know, I think I'm actually starting to like the taste of so called "long pork". Just wish I had a nice Chianti to wash it down with, maybe some fava beans on the side.
cannibalEatDead_outcome2_6 = The meat in our bellies means we'll live to see another day, but images of [Name] turning on the spit are going to haunt my dreams.




# Price of Pork - People start going nuts from eating each other (allude to that brain whassit you get from eating human brains). Someone kills someone else, one possible punishment is to kill and eat him.
cannibalCrazy_title = Eating One Another
cannibalCrazy_picture = breakdown
cannibalCrazy_1 = [FormalName] was always a bit of creepy [dude], and I don't think all the unusual "meat" in [his] diet is helping. Knocking [Name2] out and trying to fit [him2] in an oven is a step too far.\n\n
We managed to stop [Name] in time, but now we need to figure out what to do with [him]. We can either leave [him] to the tender mercies of the zed outside the walls... or we could allow [him] to "serve" his sentence another way.
cannibalCrazy_2 = Everyone's been at one another's throats like a pack of wild dogs since we started eating that "long pork", but it hit [FormalName] the worst. We found [him] in [his] room yesterday, sharpening a collection of knives while [Name2] lay drugged and unconscious not far away.\n\n
We managed to subdue [Name], but no one is going to feel safe so long as [he] has free roam of the fort. We're either going to have to kick [him] out, or we need to find another solution so [he] never hurts anyone again.
cannibalCrazy_option1 = Jail time and vegetarian diet
cannibalCrazy_option2 = Force [him] to leave
cannibalCrazy_option3 = Kill and eat [him]
cannibalCrazy_outcome1_1 = We put [Name] up in a prison cell and gave [him] a chard salad for dinner. Well it was all we could find that wasn't human flesh. We really do eat a lot of the stuff these days.\n\n
Somehow [he] escaped a few hours later, as if someone helped [him] do it. [He] seems to have left the fort, but I'm worried. I hope we're all safe tonight...
cannibalCrazy_outcome1_2 = We tried to tame [Name] but [his] madness was farther gone than I'd realized. [He] bit my hand when I came to feed [him] dinner. Hungrily, like a zombie.\n\n
No: like a cannibal.\n\n
Sometime during the night [Name] hung [himself] in [his] prison cell. It's terrible to say but, [his] death may be for the best. I don't think there's any coming back from where [he] was.
cannibalCrazy_outcome2_1 = It seems like [Name] certainly lost [his] mind. I feel like we had no choice but to kick [him] out, and [he] seemed to understand why we did it. [He] left willingly.\n\n
I haven't told the others, but I've been feeling a little weird myself. Sometimes my hands tremble....
cannibalCrazy_outcome2_2 = We told [Name] to leave [CityName] and never return. [He] rolled [his] eyes crazily and told me I'd be sorry.\n\n
On cold nights I could swear you can still [him] cackling in the distances, though I sometimes I have to wonder if that isn't my own laughter.
cannibalCrazy_outcome3_1 = It's only fair. [Name] tried to make a meal out of one of us, so we made a meal out of [him]. Waste not, want not.
cannibalCrazy_outcome3_2 = Justice has been served... in this case with nice white sauce and a handful of brussels sprouts.


# Bad Meat - Eating someone killed by zombies might cause one of your survivors to turn a few days later. Very rare but scary!
# Name/FormalName = person turned and killed
cannibalBadMeat_title = Bad Meat
cannibalBadMeat_picture = food
cannibalBadMeat_1 = I don't think that last fella we ate was as fresh as we thought.\n\n
[FormalName] complained the meat tasted funnier than usual. [He] was looking green around the gills when [he] went to bed last night, and when we checked on [him] in the morning [he] had all the symptoms of being bit.\n\n
[Name] turned that afternoon. I guess this is a lesson for us: check people thoroughly for bite marks before you sink your teeth into them.
cannibalBadMeat_2 = We're usually really careful about only eating healthy people, but somebody let some zombie-infected meat into our larder. We're just lucky [FormalName] dug into it for a midnight snack... if we'd served it for dinner it might have infected more of us before we realized.\n\n
Now [Name] is dead, and 'cause [he] was infected, we can't eat [him].
cannibalBadMeat_option1 = Throw the rest of the bad meat out
cannibalBadMeat_option2 = Take a chance and eat it
cannibalBadMeat_outcome1 = We threw the rest of that batch of human meat out. Honestly I've lost my appetite for any kind of red meat at all. Maybe we could grow some nice veggies instead?
cannibalBadMeat_outcome2 = No need to throw it out; we'll just cook the rest of the meat to a crisp. That should kill any disease in there, from E. coli to zombieism. No more rare hamburgers (or [Name]burgers) for me thanks.



# The Gourmand - Entitled guy comes to the fort, you can eat him. Only if you're seriously evil cannibals.
cannibalGourmand_title = The Gourmand
cannibalGourmand_picture = gate
cannibalGourmand_1 = There's a celebrity at the gates. [FormalName] was a big-time politician back in the day. I remember he was all over the papers that time he [played footsies with his secretary|revoked all those same-sex marriage licenses|got caught on video smoking hash in somebody's basement].\n\n
He used his influence to get into one of those high-tech military bunker as everything was falling apart, but they managed to eat through their 10-year supply of food in less than 5. He's looking for a new home. Should we let him in?
cannibalGourmand_option1 = Invite him in
cannibalGourmand_option2 = Tell him to get lost
cannibalGourmand_outcome1_1 = [Name] blustered in and took over in our nicest empty house. [He] refuses to work and has already started stealing food and ordering people around. Everybody hates him, and we can barely feed ourselves, let alone this greedy bastard.\n\n
He can't stay, but he could still be useful.... Should we eat him?
cannibalGourmand_outcome1_2 = We invited [Name] to join us.\n\n
Annoyingly, [he] refuses to do a lick of work and just sits around all day eating. [He]'s barely been here a day and is already eating us out of house and home, and harasses any woman who comes near him. I'm guessing he didn't get told "No" much in his old life.\n\n
We can't let this continue. We need to get rid of him. The question is, what's the best solution for everyone involved?
cannibalGourmand_outcome1_option1 = Demand that he leave
cannibalGourmand_outcome1_option2 = Eat [Name]
cannibalGourmand_outcome1_outcome1_pictureColin = false
cannibalGourmand_outcome1_outcome1 = We sent [Name] packing. There's no room for him here. I hope he finds his place in the world, so long as people hungrier and meaner than us don't find him first.
cannibalGourmand_outcome1_outcome2_picture = grave
cannibalGourmand_outcome1_outcome2 = Bill was a remnant of the old world, and we gave him a hard lesson about the new. We had no real choice. We have to survive today if we're going to make tomorrow a better place.
cannibalGourmand_outcome2_pictureColin = false
cannibalGourmand_outcome2 = We sent the guy packing. He could have used his money and influence to help avert this disaster instead of spending it all on a fortified palace for himself. He can find another group to mooch off of.

That'll teach [FormalName] to plow through gates without looking. Now the bottom of [his] {1} is all torn up and leaking some green fluid.\n\n
[Faction] came over to watch. Not sure if they're willing to help, or just want to laugh at our predicament.
carBreakdown_2 = You've got to be careful driving [CityName's] filthy, cracked streets these days. More careful than [FormalName].

Things don't look good. I'm going to need some parts  from the fort if I'm going to get the thing running again. Otherwise I'm going to have to try to push a couple of tons of metal home. It sure would be handy to have some help if I need to do that.

carBreakdown_outcome1_outcome1 = We may not always get on well with [faction], but I sure was glad to have them keeping the zed off our backs as we pushed the old rust bucket home. Actually it's not in as bad shape as it initially seemed, and we'll be able to fix it.
# -5 materials, same as above
carBreakdown_outcome1_outcome2 = We may not always get on well with [faction], but I sure was glad to have them keeping the zed off our backs as we pushed the old rust bucket home. Actually it's not in as bad shape as it initially seemed, and we'll be able to fix it.
# -5 respect
carBreakdown_outcome1_outcome3 = [FactionLeader] rolled [factionHis] eyes, and they helped [Name] push the {1} back to our fort. I don't think any of them were very impressed with us, but they owed us one.
# show original 4 options again, but option1 is now greyed out
carBreakdown_outcome1_outcome4 = Well, we can either push it, or leave it. Move it, or lose it. Shove it, or ditch it.
# no effect
carBreakdown_outcome2 = [Name] just seems to have a way with combustible engines. They respond to [him]. Somehow [he] got it running and drove it back to the fort, leaking fluids and dropping parts the whole way there.\n\n
Don't worry, we'll get it fixed up... I think the two of them have formed a real bond.
# the option says danger, but is actually only just happiness minus
# -20 happiness "Damn car broke down and I had to push it home"
carBreakdown_outcome3 = We managed to get the {1} home in the end, but it wasn't pretty. After [*the third hill|the steering wheel fell off|it got stuck in an open manhole], [Name] was ready to abandon it. But they made it home, and we managed to get it running again with a bit of TLC.
# lose the vehicle
carBreakdown_outcome4 = It sucks to leave the {1} behind, but we've got more important things to worry about. Our lives for one.\n\n
Besides, it's not like the city isn't full of rusting things with wheels. The trick is finding one that still works.

# MINI MISC QUESTLINES
######################################

# Water treatment plant - Need a water treatment plant in the fort. Event tells you there's a new quest available on it to fix it, costs materials and engineers are better at it. But suddenly just as they finish, zombies come welling up out of the pipes and fill the plant (which is still inside your fort). A new dangerous quest mission to kill them all, after which the plant is fixed and active. Result: increased happiness and affects other events.

# pops up when you reclaim the building or shortly after
# an exclamation point will appear on the water treatment plant, quest mission name is "Repair water treatment plant"
waterTreatmentReclaimed_title = Water Treatment Repairs Needed
waterTreatmentReclaimed_picture = industrial
waterTreatmentReclaimed_pictureColin = false
waterTreatmentReclaimed_1 = I figured as soon as we got a water treatment plant in the fort [*I could stop collecting rainwater from the gutters every time I wanted a cup of tea|I'd be able revel in the ecstasy of a having a toilet that actually flushes], but no such luck. The plant's busted and it's going to take some effort and a bunch of building materials to get it working again.\n\n
If we've got a clever engineer or two we can spare, we might just be able to experience the joys of indoor plumbing once again.
waterTreatmentReclaimed_2 = Who knew plumbing would be this complicated? Sure, having a water treatment plant in the fort is a good start, but that thing hasn't been running in ages, on account of [*all the body parts blocking up the pipes|the 'backlog' of waste that built up over the years].\n\n
We need the time of a few engineers and any building materials we've got to spare if we want to get the thing running again.
waterTreatmentReclaimed_3 = I just took a look through the water treatment plant we reclaimed, and things don't look good. The pipes are backed up, the main pump is a solid block of rust and the place is so full of gasses all it would take is a single match to bring it down around our heads.\n\n
We can probably get the thing working again, but it won't be easy. It's going to take our best engineers and plenty of gear before anything liquid flows through those pipes again.

# pops up when you finish repairing water treatment plant
# new exclamation point on the plant says "Kill zombies"
waterTreatmentFixed_title = Water Treatment Exterminators Needed
waterTreatmentFixed_picture = industrial
waterTreatmentFixed_pictureColin = false
waterTreatmentFixed_1 = Good news! The water treatment plant is fixed!\n\n
Now we just need to deal with the minor detail of the massive horde of zed that crawled up out of the newly unblocked sewer pipes and have been trying to eat anyone who goes near the building. I'm looking for volunteers...
waterTreatmentFixed_2 = It's taken hours of blood, sweat and tears, but the treatment plant is fixed and ready to start pumping [*liters|gallons] of fresh water to the parched throats of [CityName].\n\n
Well, it's all ready aside from the horde of undead-types who climbed out of the freshly-cleaned sewer pipes and have taken up residence in the building. We just need to clear them out and everything will be perfect.
waterTreatmentFixed_3 = So, it turns out that gurgling we heard coming from the sewer pipes as we fixed up the water treatment plant wasn't just [*the old runoff|marsh gas escaping|rats digging in the muck]. It looks like there was a horde of Zed packed away in there and now that we've cleared things away, they've climbed out of the pipes and have taken over the plant.\n\n
The good news is we got all the fixes in place before this happened. The bad news is no one had a chance to hit the 'ON' switch, and we'll need to deal with the undead before we can.

waterTreatmentWorking_title = Running Water
waterTreatmentWorking_picture = industrial
waterTreatmentWorking_pictureColin = false
waterTreatmentWorking_effect = Running water in the city
waterTreatmentWorking = Huzzah! We have running water again and it doesn't smell like rotting corpses! Everyone's feeling great and we're one step closer to rebuilding society.

# Dirty water - Needs water treatment plant in the city but not in the fort or not fixed. Someone gets sick (injury mission) because the water you're drinking is collected from rooftops and swimming pools and is impure. You've got basic filters but wish you had running water in houses like before. Mention Giardia, Cryptosporidia, brita filters, charcoal, life straws etc.
# [FormalName] = person sick from bad water
waterTreatmentNeeded_title = Tainted Liquid
waterTreatmentNeeded_picture = sad
waterTreatmentNeeded_pictureColin = false
waterTreatmentNeeded_1 = [FormalName] ain't lookin' so good this evening. We think [he] forgot to boil the water [he] used when making [his] special [*runny cake|stone soup|brownies] and now [he]'s stuck in the outhouse emptying [his] stomach. [He]'s probably going to need a few days to recover after this.\n\n
Looking up [his] symptoms in old medical textbook, we think it's called somethin' fancy like [*Amoebiasis|Giardia|Cryptosporidia], but in the end a stomach bug is a stomach bug. This wouldn't be an issue if we had a water treatment plant. Until then we're going to have to clean up the water we collect as best we can.
waterTreatmentNeeded_2 = We get enough rainfall that collecting water in the few basins, bathtubs and pools we've spread around the fort isn't usually much of an issue. Making sure the water is safe to drink, on the other hand...\n\n
Despite our best efforts with [*using old camp water filters|our jury-rigged charcoal filters|boiling everything in sight] some stuff still gets through, and now [FormalName] is laid up in bed wishing we had a working stomach pump. I just wish we had had a working water treatment plant. Then we wouldn't have to worry about any of this.
waterTreatmentNeeded_3 = We do what we can to filter the water we collect 'round town, but that only does so much and now [FormalName's] picked up some sort of sickness.\n\n
Dammit! We never had to worry about gettin' [*Botulism|Dysentery|Typhoid fever] just from drinkin' the water in these parts 'till those zombies rose up and water treatment plant broke down. Things would be a lot better if we could get it under our control and running again.


# Clean Water - Runs instead of dirty water if you fixed the treatment plant. People are so happy they have running water in their homes and are safe from disease, + happiness.
# [FormalName] = person who is using the water to have fun
waterTreatmentHappy_title = Clean Water
waterTreatmentHappy_picture = happy
waterTreatmentHappy_pictureColin = false
waterTreatmentHappy_1 = I just poured myself a nice clear glass of water from the tap. It's the small things in life that really make it really worthwhile, and not finding [*slugs|paint chips|rat hair] in your water definitely counts. I sure am glad we got that treatment plant up and running.
waterTreatmentHappy_2 = [Name] opened one of the fire hydrants this morning and we had a full on water-filled street party to let everyone cool off. Getting that treatment plant working was one of the best ideas we ever had.
waterTreatmentHappy_3 = For me, nothing says Civilization like clean running water. This is a great thing we've done, we should all be proud.
waterTreatmentHappy_4 = Just feels good to have water flowing in and sewage flowing out. We've achieved a level of technology on par with Romans from 2000 years ago.
waterTreatmentHappy_5 = I never thought something as simple as a [*warm bath|indoor toilet|working bidet] would give me so much pleasure, but there you go. The clean drinking water's pretty nice too.


# can happen if our water policy is set to allow showering
# treatment plant breaks and needs to be fixed
waterBrokeAgain_title = So thirsty
waterBrokeAgain_picture = industrial
waterBrokeAgain_pictureColin = false
waterBrokeAgain = The taps are dry! Just some brown sludge coming out of them today. Our policy of using the water for so many baths and showers and such must have overloaded the water treatment plant. It's getting old, so we'll have to expect this will happen now and then.\n\n
We have to send someone over to fix it up and get it running again.
waterBrokeAgain_effect = Mission available to Fix the water treatment plant

# when the mission is complete
waterBrokeAgainFixed_title = Thirst quenched
waterBrokeAgainFixed_picture = industrial
waterBrokeAgainFixed_pictureColin = false
waterBrokeAgainFixed = We fixed the water treatment plant again. Might want to change our policy on water usage and showering, or we'll have to do this again in a few months.
waterBrokeAgainFixed_effect = Running water in the city again

# Power Plant - Like water treatment plant - needs a gas power plant in the fort. Starts with an event saying hey we should fix this thing. Then a mission on the plant that engineers are best at. But there's more - there's a part they need, we need to make it in a workshop out of hella hella materials and time (another quest mission) OR from a faction (see below). Then back to the power plant to install it and put some fuel in it, and boom done. Result: increased happiness and other events  mc-gf1n

powerPlantReclaimed_title = More Power Needed
powerPlantReclaimed_picture = industrial
powerPlantReclaimed_pictureColin = false
powerPlantReclaimed_1 = Well, now that we've got a power plant in our fort walls, all we need to do is get the thing working again. After all, how hard could it be to fix an industrial-sized facility capable generating enough juice to run a whole city?\n\n
Oh... turns out our engineers think it's going to be pretty hard. Still, if we give them enough time and resources they should be able to get something up and running again.
powerPlantReclaimed_2 = Sometimes I like to play with the light switches. Sure, they don't do nothin' nowadays, but I find the clicking noises kind of soothing. Reminds me of the good old days.\n\n
Of course, now that we've got a power plant inside our fort walls, we might just be able to get these things workin' again. Sure it'll probably take our best engineers and plenty of time and resources, but I think the ability to create light on demand would be worth it.
powerPlantReclaimed_3 = The old power plant has seen better days. All the old dials are broken, the walls are covered with dust and grime, and the pile of bodies in the janitor's closet is really beginning to smell.\n\n
Still, it would help if we could get the thing running again. It'll take our engineers time and a good chunk of building materials, but if we can spare those we can look forward to having working [*lights|ovens|fridges] again.

powerPlantFixed_title = The Principal Power Plant Part
powerPlantFixed_picture = industrial
powerPlantFixed_pictureColin = false
powerPlantFixed_1 = Well, we've got good news and we've got bad news.\n\n
The good news is that our engineers have pretty much got the power plant fixed. The wires are checked, dials are polished, and they even got the smell of rotting corpses out of the building's cafeteria.\n\n
The bad news is we're missing a key mc-gf1n [*industrial-sized sprocket|circuit board|electro-magnet] that's needed to get the thing running again. We can probably make one ourselves in a workshop, but it's going to take a metric-ton of materials.
powerPlantFixed_2 = We just got word from our engineers. They got most of the power plant in working order, but there's a problem: The main generator is missing an important mc-gf1n [*woodruff key|armature|field coil] and we don't have any spares on hand.\n\n
We might be able to make one ourselves, but it ain't going to be easy. We're gonna need a workshop and heck of a lot of materials. I don't like pushing our engineers for more after all the work they've been doing, but this is probably worth it.
powerPlantFixed_3 = Despite the lack of [*spare parts|instructions manuals|proper tools] and the constant [*zombie attacks|rain seeping through the holes in the roof|yowling from the family of feral cats that has setup in the basement] we've got the power plant fixed... for the most part. It looks like we're short a critical mc-gf1n [*exhaust pipe|housing unit|isolator kit] and until we get one we aren't going to get so much as single Watt of power out of that thing.\n\n
We may be able to put together a replacement in our workshop, but it's going to take more time and a lot more material.

powerPlantPartMade_title = Power Plant Part Produced
powerPlantPartMade_picture = industrial
powerPlantPartMade_pictureColin = false
powerPlantPartMade_1 = I don't really understand why putting together such a tiny part would take so much material, but there you go. Now all we need is a little energon and a lot of luck...\n\n
Sorry, that was an old movie line from my childhood. I mean we just need to install the mc-gf1n and get together some gas to get things running.
powerPlantPartMade_2 = The problem with not having any power and having to make everything by hand is it takes a lot longer to put things together. Not to mention you're going to burn through materials with all the duds you end up with.\n\n
Anyway, the mc-gf1n part is complete and now all we need to do is install it. Oh, and we'll need some gas to get the starter generator running again, but given all the abandoned cars in the city, that shouldn't be too hard to find.
powerPlantPartMade_3 = OK, yeah, I know I should have been more patient with the engineers. And yes, my sticking my head into the workshop every day, asking 'Is it done yet?' probably didn't help. Still, I learned some colorful new language when they got fed up with me.\n\n
Oh, and the mc-gf1n part is finished. We just need to get it into the plant, along with a bit of fuel to get everything running, and we should be good as gold.

# Power plant part trade - Alternative to making the part we need - faction shows up saying they happen to have one. 3 ways to get the part: give them medicine, threaten them (roll against their strength for success - they hate us more either way), or just ask if they like us enough.
# [faction] = faction who shows up with the part.
# {1} = Amount of medicine needed
powerPlantPartTrade_title = Pricey Power Plant Part
powerPlantPartTrade_picture = industrial
powerPlantPartTrade_pictureColin = [FactionLeader]
powerPlantPartTrade_1 = Seems [FactionLeader] caught wind of our power plant trouble, and it just so happens [faction] have the mc-gf1n part we need to get the plant runnin' again. All [factionHe]'s asking for is a small donation of {1} medicine in return for handing it over.\n\n
Of course, we could just take the part from [factionHim] by force. [FactionHe] doesn't have that many guards with  [factionHim]...
powerPlantPartTrade_2 = [FactionLeader] from [faction] just pulled up to gate. They need medicine for one of their [men|women] and [factionHe]'d like to trade for some.\n\n
As luck would have it, [factionHe] actually has the mc-gf1n part we need to finish fixing our power plant. [FactionHe] said [factionHe]'d part with it for {1} medicine. That is, unless we want to try and take the mc-gf1n by force.
powerPlantPartTrade_3 = I was chatting with one of the [FactionNoThe] this morning and happened to mention we've kind of hit a brick wall getting our power plant running. As luck would have it, one of their scavengers recently stumbled on the very mc-gf1n part we need to get everything running.\n\n
Of course, now that [FactionLeader] knows we need the thing, it ain't gonna be cheap. [FactionHe] wants {1} medicine for it. Honestly, I'm kind of tempted to just try and take it by force.
powerPlantPartTrade_option1 = Pay the {1} medicine
powerPlantPartTrade_option2 = Ask for the part nicely (respect 80)
powerPlantPartTrade_option3 = Threaten [factionHim] with violence
powerPlantPartTrade_option4 = We'll make our own
powerPlantPartTrade_outcome1 = Our medicine stores are a bit lighter and [faction] is gonna be that bit stronger, but at least we've got the part we need. Now, all we have to do is install it and, with a bit of fuel, we should be able to get everything running again.
powerPlantPartTrade_outcome2 = We pulled out the puppy dog eyes and [FactionLeader] caved and handed over the part. It didn't hurt that [factionHe] liked us in the first place.
powerPlantPartTrade_outcome3_success = It probably wasn't a bright idea for [FactionLeader] to have brought the part along with [factionHim]. A few short words and couple of guns pointed in [factionHis] direction, and [factionHe] handed it over all meek and mousy-like.\n\n
Sure, [factionHe]'s not so happy with us after this, but what do we care? All we need to do is install the part, gas up the generators and we'll to be the ones with the power!
powerPlantPartTrade_outcome3_fail = We snarled and threaten but [FactionLeader] just sneered at us and walked off. Great. Now we still don't have the part we need, _and_ the [factionNoThe] are annoyed with us.
powerPlantPartTrade_outcome4 = [FactionLeader] was surprised that we didn't want to buy the part off [factionHim] after all. I guess now [factionHe]'s wondering what the heck [factionHe]'s going do with such a specific item.

powerPlantWorking_title = The Power is Mine, ALL MINE!!!
powerPlantWorking_picture = industrial
powerPlantWorking_pictureColin = false
powerPlantWorking_effect = City now has electricity
powerPlantWorking_1 = I was never a big fan of the emissions these old-style plants belch into the atmosphere, but we've got worse things to worry about right now. The power we get from this thing will make our lives so much easier.\n\n
Plus, it's not like the rest of the human race are burning toxic fossil fuels anymore. Not with them mostly being dead, that is.
powerPlantWorking_2 = I never would have thought the hum of a generator starting up would be so soothing, but there you go. I'm actually thinking of setting up a sleeping bag in here tonight. If nothing else, the white noise should drown out the screams of the undead.
powerPlantWorking_3 = We spent the evening dancing through the street lights that flickered to life as the power plant whirred into action. The singing and cheering could be heard throughout the fort.\n\n
And we weren't the only ones dancing in the lights. I don't know that I've seen that many moths since before the zed rose up. I'd never have thought the cloth-eating bastards would be something I would have missed, but there you go.


# Yay Power - Once you have a working power plant, people are +happy
powerPlantHappy_title = The Joys of Power
powerPlantHappy_picture = happy
powerPlantHappy_pictureColin = false
powerPlantHappy_1 = I stayed up late last night, reading by the light of my bedside lamp. I'd forgotten how much I'd missed that. We're all a lot happier now that the power plant is up and running again.
powerPlantHappy_2 = Electric ovens are amazing things. They cook things evenly, at whatever temperature you like, and you don't need to rub two sticks together every time you want to get one started. Getting power back has been a godsend for everyone in the fort.
powerPlantHappy_3 = You know what's a lot better now that we have power? Our shadow puppet shows. You might not think it, but trying to do a show by the light of the fire makes it really hard to get a defined shape on a wall.\n\n
Now that we've got working lights again people are coming with all sorts of new shapes and animals to include in their productions.
powerPlantHappy_4 = Now that we've got electricity running we can have karaoke night again!\n\n
Seeing the dead walk is almost as disconcerting as finding out which of your friends is only three hooch-and-sodas away from a Tom Jones medley.

antivenomProgress = I visited [FormalName] in [his] lab today to check on [his] progress on that disease research. It doesn't look good... [he] said it took a couple weeks just to start to understand the disease, but [his] first attempts at experimenting with it have failed.\n\n
[He] says [he] needs a live subject. I asked if [he] meant one us and [he] laughed. Of course not - [he] wants a live zombie.
antivenomProgress_option1 = Agree to get [him] a live zombie
antivenomProgress_option2 = Refuse.
antivenomProgress_outcome1 = The safest way to catch a live zombie is to set a trap and come collect them at our leisure. We'll have to have an engineer make some in a workshop first, then set them up outside our walls.
antivenomProgress_outcome2 = Having living zombies inside the fort sounds like a bad plan. I told [Name] [he]'d have to find some way to do [his] research without them. [He] gave a few deep, frustrated sighs, then asked me to please leave so [he] could concentrate on [his] work.
antivenomProgress_outcome2Policy = I'm afraid we have a policy against experimentation on the undead. It's just indecent, doing things to the bodies of people who were once loved, and might still be able to feel in some capacity.\n\n
[Name] sighed and ran [his] hands through [his] hair. [He] really isn't sure this research is getting anywhere, but [he]'ll keep trying.

[FormalName] was delighed when we showed up at the lab with it. [He] thinks the research will go much faster now.

antivenomDone = [FormalName]'s been shut in that lab alone for the last month. [He]'s been so intent on [his] research, [he] doesn't even come out to eat with the rest of us anymore, and I gave [him] a hiatus on nightly guard duty.\n\n
But for the past two nights we noticed the lights on the lab have been left on all night. I'm worried something might have happened to [him].
antivenomDone_option1 = Investigate...
antivenomDone_outcome1 = We went in with weapons drawn, fearing the worst. [Name] met us in a frenzy of excitement. "It worked!" [he] yelled, and showed me a fresh bite mark on [his] arm. "The antivenom worked! See? No fever!" [He] grabbed my hand and held it to [his] forehead. True enough, [he] seemed to be healthy.\n\n
Like snake antivenom, you need to take it immediately after getting bit, and it will only work the first time you take it. But it's our best defense so far against this disease. We congratulated [FormalName] and welcomed [him] back to society.

[He] explained, between sobs, that [he]'d spotted [his] [father|mother|brother|sister] among the undead on the other side of our wall.\n\n
[Name] had hoped against hope that [his] [dad|mom|brother|sister] had escaped the horror somehow, but there was no mistaking [him|her|him|her].
remember_2 = I was checking the west wall with [FormalName] when out of nowhere [he] started shouting "[David! David!|Carol! Carol!|Finnegan! Finnegan!|Sophie! Sophie!]" and ran for the gate.\n\n
There was nothing out there but zombies... then I understood. [Name] had recognized one of them. A relative I'd guess, from the way [he] reacted.\n\n
I caught up in time and held [him] back so [he] couldn't open the gate and run out there to them.
remember_3 = [FormalName's] [dad|mom|brother|sister] had prepped [his|her|his|her] entire life. The gun stockpile. The years' worth of rations. The bomb shelter that could survive the big one.\n\n
To hear [Name] tell it, [his] [dad|mom|brother|sister] was a born survivor. Yet there [he|she|he|she] is now, clawing at our walls, tearing [his|her|his|her] fingernails off in [his|her|his|her] eagerness to eat our brains.

# -20 happiness
remember_outcome1 = [Name's] hands shook so hard I was worried the shot would go wide. [He] stood at the wall, aiming the gun at [his] long-lost relative, then bringing [his] arm down again and shaking [his] head.\n\n
I decided this was something [Name] had to do alone, so we left [him] there.\n\n
The zombie was gone the next time I checked. Either [Name] killed and buried [him|her|him|her], or [he] gave up and the zombie wandered away on [his|her|his|her] own.
# they become enemies with the main leader
remember_outcome2 = I killed the zombie, quick and clean, a knife through the skull.\n\n
[Name] cried out and burst into tears. [He] won't speak to me now, but I know what I did was for [his] own good. That wasn't a person anymore. It was nothing but a shell.
# remove this option and show the others
remember_outcome3 = [Name] stammered and tears welled in [his] eyes. Seems like [he] can't decide whether to run out there and embrace the zombie, or to open fire.\n\n
Looks like I'll have to decide for [him].
remember_outcome4 = I pulled [Name] away from the wall. Whoever that used to be, I told [him], that isn't [him|her|him|her] anymore. It's just a zombie that looks kind of like [him|her|him|her]. No more or less important than the thousand other undead in this city.\n\n
[Name] seemed relieved to put off the confrontation. Hopefully the zombie will wander off on its own.

puppies_outcome1 = We brought {1} to a sterile room and had hot water and blankets ready when the puppies popped out. But something was wrong: two of the three pups lay still and weren't breathing.\n\n
We went to work on those helpless little forms, massaging their chests and breathing little puffs of air into their lungs. After a tense minute, one blew out a snort and started breathing. It was saved!\n\n
Welcome to the world, {3}. We're sad your sister didn't make it.
puppies_outcome2 = Dogs are animals. They can take care of themselves.\n\n
Sure enough, {1} knew what to do. She disappeared to some secret cave she'd chosen and gave birth in private. Eventually she brought one puppy out to meet us. I'm not sure what happened to the rest, if there were any, but we're happy to have little {3} join us.

reclaimHiding_pictureColin2 = false
reclaimHiding_1 = Reclaiming this [square] is like five jobs in one: disposing the dead, avoiding the undead, hauling materials, constructing the wall, and lunch.\n\n
Didn't expect that last step to be the dangerous one. While [we] [were] taking a break, a [man] suddenly stumbled out of a barn and fired two shots over my head. I _think_ [he] missed on purpose, but I dove to the ground anyway.
reclaimHiding_2 = [We] [were] nearly finished walling off the [square] when this big cellar door - [we]'d thought it was locked - suddenly popped open.\n\n
This [dude] came charging out with a torch in one hand and a rifle in the other, screaming like a [man] storming the front. I thought [he] was going to kill me.\n\n
Well, [he] still might. Now [he]'s pointing that gun at my chest and demanding we leave the farm.
reclaimHiding_3 = While [we] [were] cleaning out the farmhouse and prepping to put that wall in, I felt something whiz past my cheek.\n\n
It took a second to realize someone was shooting at [us] from the farmhouse attic. I guess this place is still inhabited... oops! The [man] up there with the rifle doesn't seem like [he] wants to join us... what do we do?
reclaimHiding_option1 = Agree to leave [him] alone
reclaimHiding_option2 = Confront the [man]
reclaimHiding_outcome1 = I yelled to the [man] - didn't want to get too close - that we didn't mean to intrude and would leave [him] to [his] farm. Then I got the hell out of there.\n\n
Maybe a leader could reason with this [guy].
# always fail and kill the guy or he runs away
# reporter gets -15 happy "I feel bad for the guy on that farm", get rifle and bullets
reclaimHiding_outcome2 = That... didn't go so well. I got closer so we could talk face to face. I figured if [he] could just look me in the eyes, you know, [he]'d understand I meant no harm.\n\n
But [he] turned that gun on me and I reacted, grabbing [his] arms and forcing them upwards... and [he] blew [his] own head off.\n\n
This was an accident. I feel terrible, I don't know what to do with myself... I guess I'll finish that wall now.


# someone doesn't come back from scavenging etc, do you send someone out to rescue them

# cancel the original mission, kill the survivor (temporarily) and create a quest mission on the square
badRescue_title = We're In This Together
badRescue_picture = creepyWoods
badRescue_pictureColin = false
badRescue_1 = [FormalName] never came back from [missioning] last night. The others think [he]'s dead, but I... I just have a feeling about this one.\n\n
We should send a rescue team to find out what's happened to [him].
badRescue_2 = It's my fault. [FormalName] wasn't feeling well this morning and didn't want to go [missioning], but I gave [him] a pep talk and forced [him] out the door.\n\n
[He]'s gone missing. Should have been back five hours ago. I know there's a good chance [he]'s dead, but... I need to know for sure.

# finish the badRescue mission
# [name] dead survivor from before, might come back to life
badRescueFinish_title = We're In This Together
badRescueFinish_picture = creepyWoods
badRescueFinish_pictureColin = false
badRescueFinish = [We] [were] worried [we] wouldn't find any trace of [FormalName], but at the [square] there was a note in [his] handwriting nailed outside a locked door. It read:\n\n
"I've been bitten. If you knock and I don't answer, please know that I never meant for this to happen. I'm so sorry everyone."
badRescueFinish_option1 = Knock
badRescueFinish_option2 = Leave
badRescueFinish_outcome1 = Why did [we] even come here? [We] know [Name] is dead...
badRescueFinish_outcome2_alive_pictureColin = true
badRescueFinish_outcome2_alive = My knock was answered by a growl from other side of the door.\n\n
"Guuuhaht do you want?" someone mumbled. It was [Name]!\n\n
The lock rattled and the door swung open. [Name] rubbed [his] eyes and blinked at [us]. [He] seems to be healthy, except for a few bruises and a nasty bite on [his] shoulder. The incubation period has passed - [he]'s going to live!
badRescueFinish_outcome2_dead = My knock was answered by a growl from other side of the door.\n\n
Not a human one.\n\n
[We] kicked the door in and put down the creature [Name] had become. It's so sad that [he] died out here alone rather than with us at home. But [he] was trying to protect us. I understand that.

# mission had to be cancelled because we lost that square
missionCancelled_title = Mission Cancelled
missionCancelled_picture = zombiesBored
missionCancelled_pictureColin = false
missionCancelled_1 = We didn't get a chance to finish [missioning] at the [square] before the undead took it from us.
missionCancelled_2 = We were [missioning] at the [square] when Zed just plowed through. We'll have to reclaim it before we can start again.
missionCancelled_3 = Man, and they were almost finished [missioning] too. But there's Zed all over the [square] now so we'll have to cancel the mission and focus on reclaiming the place from them.
missionCancelled_4 = Since we lost the [square], we had to cancel the [missioning] mission there until further notice.
missionCancelled_5 = Those guys [missioning] in the [square] had to put it off because that area's in hostile territory now.
