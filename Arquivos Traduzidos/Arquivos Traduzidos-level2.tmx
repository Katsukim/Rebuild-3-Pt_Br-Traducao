We can build a replacement propeller at a workshop. And we should ask other factions if they know of any pilots.</seg>

There isn't much equipment left, but we stumbled on an old cobweb-covered crop duster. It wouldn't hold a lot of people, but if we could get that plane running, we'd have an escape route if things went wrong.

Of course, we'll have to reclaim that farm before we try anything. It'll be tough to taxi down a runway if zed keep getting caught in the propeller.</seg>

        <seg>I ran into [FormalName] guarding our store house. [He] wanted to hear about our plans to fly out of here on our fancy new plane and if there was anything [he] could do to improve his chances of coming along.

I tried to brush [him] off, but [he] was insistent: "Don't you know how hard I work around here? You think these vegetables are going to guard themselves? I tell ya, if a [man] knew [he] was going to be left behind, [he] might just skip out on guard duty. Then where would we be if someone comes after our turnips?"</seg>

I told [him] we hadn't worked that out yet and [he] scowled at me: "Listen bud, you shouldn't wait on those kind of decisions. It worries people... and who knows what might happen if we start to think you're going to leave us behind."</seg>

We could try shooting them from back here, but it'll rile them up something fierce. Maybe if got the warehouse's backup generator running we could fry all the zed in their own juices.

Then we signed a huge stack of papers detailing the terms of our alliance, in triplicate. They'll send us {1}, we'll support their military operations and share espionage intelligence. Not sure how much of this is actually relevant, but it's good to know they've got our back.</seg>

"All I know, " he said, "is you folks are as righteous as any I've met on God's green earth. You do unto others as you'd be done by them."

He led us in prayer, to give thanks for bringing us all together to save [CityName] as allies. When he said "amen", the other Last Judgement men fired their guns into the air and whooped. I guess that seals it.</seg>

        <seg>Dara cruised in on a longboard and yelled "Hack the Planet!" in greeting. I _think_ she was being sarcastic, but it's hard to tell.

She gave an... interesting... speech. She said we were "twinked-out newbs" at first (an insult, I think), but we've proved our ability to "grind" and "score crits" (good things?), and this alliance is going to help "level up" [CityName].

She was being obtuse on purpose, but maybe just to be funny. Anyway, I agree: with their help, we're going to level this city up. Alliance FTW.</seg>

Tiff just kind of smiled and waved at the crowd.

He hesitated, then pulled away and laughed deeply. "Aw heck... you know, you know. Now let's get to the celebrating. My boys are itching to fire up that BBQ."

Yep, I were a pig farmer. Nothin' as big as them Bucket boys, o' course. They had one of the biggest pig farms on the west coast. I was just a small-town farmer. But let me tell you, my pigs won best of show five seasons runnin' at the annual Harvest Festival and Hootenanny. What other farmer can say that?</seg>

        <seg>Farmer Bucket? Yeah, I knew him. Not well, but he bought a few of my prize boars for breeding stock. Though, I have to say, it wasn't a deal we made often.

I never much cared for the state he kept his pens or pigs in. When I went to visit all his porkers were packed into their pens so tight they could barely move, and the place didn't look like it had been cleaned in months. Personally, I wouldn't trust any of his meat as far as I could throw it.</seg>

        <seg>My life outside the office was what I really lived for. Playing drums in one of our local bands, gaming, running around with a bunch of topless people granting wishes. It was important to keep things interesting, you know?

I even had plans all ready when the zombies showed up, but I was away from home and I couldn't make it back to my family in time. I hope they made it out OK. To prepare, I taught the kids sword fighting as best I could. I got a few angry messages from the local schools, but at least I knew they'd be safe.</seg>

I got a surprising number of compliments upon joining. I believe the phrase "well marbled" was used. I assumed that was something similar to "statuesque". I may have assumed wrong.</seg>

        <seg>What am I doing up at this hour? Just like to spend my time keeping an eye on things. Never been a good sleeper or needed to eat much, so I always had a lot of time on my hands.

That's why used to go for the night shift when I was a security guard. Figured if I'm going to be up anyway, I may as well do something with myself. Sure, it's mostly just twiddling my thumbs, but at least I wasn't twiddling my thumbs at home every night.</seg>

        <seg>So, the last night I was actually guarding something, I was at the front desk when I hear this pounding coming from the glass doors in the entrance hall. An incessant sort of 'thud... thud... thud'.

I go to check it out and see this woman, drenched in blood, beating her head against the glass over and over. As I get close she slowly raises her face, the empty sockets where her eyes used to be stare at me for what seems like an eternity. And then she screams and smashes through the door at me!</seg>

Still, just goes to show you the difference between what happens with glass in the movies and what happens in real life. Even a zombie ain't good for much if its body is sliced into a thousand pieces.</seg>

        <seg>We found that goddamn howling zombie in the [square] and put an end to it. It was in an odd condition: it seems somebody had attacked it with a sword at some point, and the poor thing was now walking around with the blade going right through its eye and passing through part of its brain. I suppose that might explain the constant wailing.

It didn't even defend itself or try to attack us, just stood there screaming until we finally put it down. We cleared out the rest of the [square] while we were at it, and kept the sword.</seg>

Some of our people think it's the work of that loopy Church of the Chosen Ones. [Name] saw one of them running around with a bunch of clothing under [his|her] arm. Maybe they're trying to make the undead more respectable?

Each zombie emerged from the group with freshly combed hair, new clothes and even the occasional splash of makeup to bring out the color in their rotten flesh.

Aside from being completely off-the-wall crazy, what I want to know is where they got all that green concealer.</seg>

        <seg>I'm not sure what the local zed have been crawling through recently but going from the chemical smell it's something fairly noxious. What's worse is it has made the zed volatile. In other words, they now have a bad habit of exploding when shot, stabbed, or hit with too much force.

You might think this is a good thing, but having the creature in your face explode when you stick a knife it is just as bad as it getting its teeth in you. It's going to be extra dangerous to send people outside the fort until this chemical dissipates.</seg>

They've been way more vicious than usual, howling at the moon and actively prowling the city, looking for victims. We're going to have to be extra careful going outside the fort until they get back to normal. Or at least as normal as man-eating walking corpses ever get.</seg>

        <seg>You know how in fantasy stories there's always some [wizard|sage|witch|crone] that's looking to pass on esoteric life advice to the hero? Well we've met the perfect modern day example of that today.

Gustav brought the elderly {1} by with his caravan, and set her up in a house nearby. She identified three of our survivors who she'd be willing to teach, but it's going to cost us {2}.</seg>

        <seg>Gustav introduced us to an elderly woman today who claims to be a master {1}. She's certainly frail enough that you've got to wonder how she survived so long.

_"Dis woman,"_ said Gustav, getting into salesman mode, _"she livink for two years alone, no problem. She only come when I tell her she can be rich woman."_

Rich indeed; she wants {2} in exchange for training one of our survivors. She's very particular with who she'll teach.</seg>

The rest of the women clearly had bought in completely, and performed a ritual to finally turn themselves into "Chosen Ones".

But they're still zed now either way, and we need to dispose of them.</seg>

        <seg>Father O'Grady met [us] at the gates with a gruff handshake. He took [us] through their cathedral to look up at the giant crucifix at the end of the hall. He quoted:

"[The Lord said to His Son, _I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel._|_Behold, the Lord will come in fire And His chariots like the whirlwind, To render His anger with fury, And His rebuke with flames of fire. For the Lord will execute judgment by fire And by His sword on all flesh, And those slain by the Lord will be many._|_The Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus._]"

I'm not sure if it was a threat or a mission statement, but he's obviously in a real hellfire mood.</seg>

I chatted with Cassandra Starr, who spoke in a voice so calm and serene you'd think she'd just had a twelve-hour massage. She was happy to answer my questions, although she kept offering me a free "What type of Zombie will you become?" personality test.

She didn't know anything about our missing person, but when I asked her about ice cream trucks she nodded. She said they regularly bought food from a truck like that, from one of the factions who had a big farm nearby.</seg>

I'll admit, the way you could almost see the quotation marks around way she said "quality" creeped me out a bit.

She couldn't remember if the van was theirs, but maybe we should ask the Pig Farmers about the van next.</seg>

        <seg>I could tell Ludd recognized the van's description, but he kept changing the subject back to his toxic cloud theory. I had to listen to another half hour of conspiracy nonsense before he fessed up.

"That ice cream van was ours," he admitted, "we used to use the loudspeakers to distract zombies on scavenging runs."

I was about to accuse him of kidnapping when Ludd put his finger up to silence me. I was worried he was pointing to the clouds again. "But, " he said, "we don't have it anymore."</seg>

        <seg>Ludd explained that the Luddies hadn't always been strict vegetarians. In the early days of the infection he'd teamed up with a man named Farmer Bucket. They'd raised chickens and pigs, though Ludd himself never ate meat, because "you could never be sure what sort of dangerous hormones it might be pumped full of".

This difference in ideology came to a head one bad winter when food was scarce. Farmer Bucket split off with some others to start the Pig Farmers.

They took that old van with them when they left, so Ludd suggested we go ask them about it.</seg>

There were plenty of footprints though, so we followed those deeper into cavernous barn. We passed stall after empty stall, gates falling off their hinges, the cobwebs getting so thick it looked like the spiders were trying to communicate.

The footprints headed out a side exit and up a ramp to an unlit concrete building.</seg>

From the light filtering through the high windows, we could see bloodstains caking the runoffs all over the walls. Chains and curved hooks hung from the rafters, jingling slightly in the breeze. Large knives lined the walls near the butchers blocks.

Off to the side we could see two large freezer doors. There was a scratching noise coming from the one on the left.</seg>

The carcasses were badly mangled and partially skinned, so it took a us awhile to realize the shapes on the hooks didn't quite look like pigs. They were leaner. They had hands. And feet.

Retching, I turned and groped at a nearby wall to steady myself. I hit the handle of the left freezer door by accident....</seg>

We waited until dark, then broke through and came up into a damp storehouse inside their fort. It used to be full of sacks of seed and grain but even the rats had given up finding anything to nibble.

We opened the doors a crack and saw three major buildings in the distance: an old stable close to the main gate, a rustic farmhouse, and a long pig barn in the back of the compound.</seg>

We took a quick look in the truck, but it was empty aside from a couple of deep freezes, stagnant water and old popsicle wrappers. We couldn't find the keys, so we decided to move on before anyone found us.</seg>

        <seg>We spotted a couple survivors running from Zed from a distance. Just when it looked like they were going to be eaten, an old "Frozen Joy" ice cream truck pulled up between them and the zed, a tinny version of "The Entertainer" tinkling from it's rusted speakers.

Shotgun blasts painted the street in zombie guts and ichor. The survivors spoke to someone inside the van, then they hopped in and rode off.

You know what they used to say about getting into strange vans...</seg>

Ludd was saying that relying too much on tech made people vulnerable and the reason they'd survived was 'cause they knew how to use their own two hands. Meanwhile Rufus was arguing that those hands were a lot more effective when they were using tools, and that's all tech was, an advanced tool.</seg>

Ludd watched him go, annoyed, then his expression softened and he mouthed the word "Pops". I guess the guy's enjoying fatherhood, such as it is.</seg>

        <seg>We heard a banging on our front gate and found Rufus there, covered in mud and out of breath. Seems one of the more clueless St Michael's kids took down a section of their fence to build a planter, and Zed poured through that hole just as soon as they found it.

There could be a hundred zombies in there now. It'd be dangerous to try to clear the school out, but we could at least rescue some of the boys. We don't have room for that many new mouths to feed, but the Luddies have plenty of food on their farm - maybe they'll adopt them.</seg>

        <seg>It was easy to power Dr Agbayani's laptop, but the CDC's security took time to bypass. Given enough time, anything can be cracked. Zombies know this; they'll smash at the same locked gate for a month if they smell meat on the other side.

We got Rufus and Ludd in for the unveiling. The kid looked fidgety. I think he's starting to believe Ludd's stories about his old man... that he created zombieism for the government and was planning to infect us from the start.

What words should we search for first?</seg>

"We can't fight this thing without help, so I'm going public with my research. I hope you can forgive me. I hope they all forgive us for failing."

So, Dr Agbayani was a good man. No wonder the government was looking for him after he shared their private research with the world.</seg>

He knew we'd talked to that kid Rufus from St Michael's and wanted to know what we learned. "You don't believe him do you? I bet his dad's home office is full of documents that could prove what really happened. Maybe even tell us how to find a cure."

        <seg>Ludd cheerily explained his theory that Dr Agbayani had been developing zombieism as a mind-control weapon. Rufus went quiet for a minute while this news about his dad sank in. Then he let out a sudden cry like a wild animal and leapt on the guy.

After I pulled Rufus off and made sure he hadn't actually clawed Ludd's eyes out, I told him I didn't believe Ludd's theory but there was only one way to know for sure: go to his old home and find the evidence.

He agreed, gave directions to a house in the suburbs and said we could leave anytime.</seg>

He also says a CDC scientist named Agbayani used to live right here in [CityName]. I remember hearing about that guy on the news a few weeks before the disease got here. He was wanted by the federal police and they offered a reward for his location.

It's too late for that reward, but this scientist might know about a cure, or at least have some answers.</seg>

He figures they created the disease to launch against China ("who we all know was breeding Smallpox"). Dr Agbayani's team was adapting it into a mind-control virus that would make people docile and complacent. He set it loose, and that's why the feds were after him.

"They were going to put it in the water, man. Turn us all into zombies. Ask that kid Rufus over at St Michael's. Agbayani was his dad."</seg>

        <seg>Rufus Agbayani and two other kids from St Michael's School for Boys came by our gates today. They looked badly malnourished. One of them was missing three of his front teeth, and I don't think those were baby teeth. Rufus apologized for not being honest earlier. The truth is they've scavenged all the food they can safely reach from their fort. The boys of St Michaels are starving.

Rufus was inspired by the Luddies' farming skills and wants to start a garden in the back field of their school. They came to see if we could help.</seg>

        <seg>Diane and I checked out one of our farms. We had some turnips planted, but they were small and sickly looking. According to diane, the soil was too dry and hard-packed, and probably low on nitrogen. We'll still grow _some_ food, but we could get more by actively farming.

The two of us spent the afternoon plowing the field and found some hidden potatoes while we were at it.</seg>

        <seg>The Last Judgment threw together a barricade from kiosks and tacky furniture. They laid into the Riffs with automatic weapons while we took pot shots from above. The Riffs darted from pillar to pillar and bore down on the Last Judgment. Their knives and shuriken sailed through cracks in the barricade with disturbing accuracy.

Father O'Grady shouted encouragement to his congregation. With rosary beads wrapped around his fists, he held his own with the martial artists slipping past the barricade. He cracked skulls and broke bones of any who dared come within reach.</seg>

All that fighting with the Zed must have taught Malik a thing or two about going for the neck, as he moved like a black guillotine through the Last Judgment's ranks, leaving a trail of headless corpses in his wake.</seg>

We could either run for our lives and clean up the mall once everyone had finished eating one another, or use what little ammunition we had left to clear our allies a path out of there. We'd probably lose the mall, but they would stand a better chance of surviving the night.</seg>

As the last zed finally fell, O'Grady and Malik looked over what was left of their forces and seemed to decide there'd been enough killing for today. They silently gathered their remaining people together and headed their separate ways.

Neither is very happy with us, but hopefully their bloodlust is sated now.</seg>

We could barely breathe by the time we made it to safety and our hearts were beating so fast, but I think most of us made it out of there alive. Not so sure about {2}. We better head over to their base now and finish them off.</seg>

He just chuckled at that and said that this wasn't the first time. The Granville Riffs were grabbing up all the best caches of supplies from round town and his fellas were starting to have to eat their boots to avoid going hungry.

He had a plan that would allow him to get rid of the Riffs once and for all, and told me he'd make it worth my while if I'd lend a hand.</seg>

Well, mostly empty. The first four guys to enter were discovered with their heads missing. They were lying in front of a blank wall which had once held the painting of the old master.

Nevertheless, Father O'Grady was in good spirits and even gave me one of his bikes as thanks. It's huge, white and covered with crosses... a bit gaudy for my tastes, but it'll get me around.</seg>

He pulled out a map of the area and pointed out the old Crossroads Mall that the Riffs used to spend their down time at.

If we cleared it of Zed and built a few walls to keep any more coming in, it wouldn't be to hard to lure the Last Judgment in with the promise of the goods that all the little boutiques still held. And between us and the Riffs, we'd be able to let the air out of the Judgment's tires permanently.</seg>

True, it hadn't been wise of his master to take on Last Judgment alone, but they'd insulted him by refusing to submit to the Riff's protection. So... this whole mess got started when the old master's power play went sour.

Malik fingered the blade's edge and stared at the picture, then told me things were already in motion. Both gangs will meet at the mall tomorrow and sort this feud out once and for all.</seg>

I think the stress of living here just got to the [guy]. It's been eating away at all of us for the past month, and we could all desperately use something to be happy about.</seg>

        <seg>I shot [Name] in the chest. [He] died instantly. What else was there to do? [He] was clearly out of control and could have opened that gate any moment. It was either [him] or us. For the greater good of the people of [CityName], I acted quickly and without hesitation.

So why do I feel so terrible?</seg>

I'll have to watch the others for signs of this kind of breakdown. We've all been feeling a lot of stress lately and this kind of thing's likely to happen again if conditions don't improve.</seg>

We buried [FormalName] in a little garden at that same [square]. I know morale has been bad here and that's partly to blame for [Name's] death, so I hope we can turn things around soon.</seg>

Gustav seemed to magically appear as soon as we found them, and demanded I hand them over like he owned them already. I'll admit, I'm tempted to pass these cigars around the fort right in front of him. We took all the risk after all.</seg>

I explained that she wants to leave the caravan, and the little man grunted. _"Well... iz not that she iz prisoner, you understand? Iz just, I pay for that girl's food and bed and bodyguard to keep her safe. I need return on my investment..."_

        <seg>I'm not sure what to do with [FormalName]. I found [him] shoving the remains of some old [*hot rod|muscle car|gas guzzler] through the front gate this morning. Seems the thing caught [his] eye and [he]'s determined to try to get it going again.

I suppose it could be a good learning experience for [him]. Should we give [him] time off to try to get it working? Or ask [him] to take the piece of junk apart and see what makes it tick? Maybe get some useful scrap out of it at least.</seg>

Looks like [FormalName] has found [himself] one such love. An [*El Camino|old SUV] that looks like it's seen better days. I don't know if [he]'ll be able to get the thing working, but [he] might learn a thing or two if [he] takes it apart.</seg>

        <seg>The entrance looked like a nondescript underground parking lot, lit by dim orange emergency lights. So we were surprised that the sliding doors at the far end still worked, and even more surprised to find a busy, well lit laboratory on the other side of them.

A rabbit in a labcoat scurried past [us]. Correction: a woman wearing a labcoat and a plastic rabbit mask scurried past. [We] followed her to the "offices" wing, trying not to stare too long at the other animal-faced scientists.

In the director's office, [we] met a familiar face...</seg>

She paused outside the director's office and spoke quickly in a hushed voice. "This project was initiated by his holiness the Living Osiris. Since he came to us, we have been but instruments to his greatness. I must leave you now but please, don't anger him..."</seg>

        <seg>"Don't answer that partner." Jesse appeared like a ghost behind [us]. As he drew his pistols, Clark hit a button on his desk and the wall beside him slid open to the sound of sirens. He dove through it and it closed again behind him.

After a startled moment, we heard his voice over the PA system:

"Hahaha, good try, but I'm behind three feet of solid steel and I've got all the research with me. You shouldn't have teamed up with the Rotten. They're useless. No imagination. They want to be _cured_ for god's sake! Who wants to be human again? Not me!"</seg>

Zombies came rushing into the hall outside, clumsily wielding baseball bats and metal pipes.

"That didn't go so well, did it?" said Jesse. "I guess there's just no dialogin' with some folks. We'll just have to blow him outta there."

I was about to say that _Jesse_ was the one who drew his gun and ruined our dialog, but he's right: explosives. We'll bring a heap of them down here and blow the door off that vault. Just as soon as we deal with all these zombies...</seg>

Jesse tipped his finger to his hat in greeting. "Howdy partners. I didn't expect your ugly pink mugs - no offence, mind - to turn up in this here little mountain town. What brings you to [CityName]?"</seg>

        <seg>"Absolutely not, " she said, crossing her arms. "The network is not some series of tubes there for your amusement. It is for top secret government use only. If people started clogging it up by playing shooter games and watching Youtubes, important government emails might not get through. For the sake of national security, we can't have that."

The senator seems to be a dead end. Maybe someone else can help us?</seg>

        <seg>We tried to stay out of the violence, acting as long-distance scouts for Senator Davis and his rebels. With our help, they could react to the senator's forces quickly, and did so by demolishing up anything in the vicinity with extreme prejudice.

The Government fort was such a mess by the time it was over that it wasn't clear _what_ they'd won, if anything. After a long meeting, it was decided the survivors would pack up and move on to another, less destroyed city. We wished them well.</seg>

We joined in the fighting. [FormalName] was shot in the shoulder while personally guarding the senator, right in the thick of things. Davis had been a marine in her youth and still remembered her training.

We won. Luckily we had no casualties, though the same can't be said for Davis' troops. Their base also took heavy damage... but with our help they can rebuild it.</seg>

        <seg>We tried to lay low until they finished demolishing the place, but the occasional stray RPG still came over our walls. Then one of them landed _on_ the walls, and we lost a {1}.

After several days of this, the two sides declared a truce among the wreckage. We could see them shaking hands, then going their separate ways: the two groups leaving the city in different directions.

"So, we've decoded the Government radio channels and we've been listening in. That's how we knew about the office tower, and about you, and one more thing."

"The Government have this thing called the network. It's the Internet, right? Invented in the 80s so they'd have a way to talk to the feds if something crazy happened. You know, crazy like the zombpocalypse, right?"</seg>

Cassandra stared deep into my eyes and told me she could ease my suffering, if only I would read her book, "the Science of Survival".

I had to refuse, since we've banned religious literature from their cult. I also told her that "science" would probably roll over in its grave if it read that book. She didn't like that.</seg>

The thing is, the evidence points to an inside job. There was blood on our side of the wall. But who among us would risk their own life to do this? Was someone trying tot _feed_ the zombies??</seg>

To reduce the cost, Cassandra Starr suggested we could begin performing paid missionary work for the church. We can send survivors door-to-door to other factions on preaching missions now.</seg>

It was sweaty, exhausting work, hauling out anything that might be useful as building materials. But we hardly noticed. We were too busy joking and playing and flirting with each other. We didn't want the day to end.

Good news is, it doesn't have to. I can assign us to work together any time I like.</seg>

        <seg>It's hard to read Malik's stony expression, but I think I saw hints of surprise and pride that his dojo-brother Jamal had made the long journey from New York through such hostile territory.

Unfortunately, the news he brought wasn't good. In the years since Malik and the others left, the remaining New York Riffs had been struggling to survive. Their sensei Cypress was ageing, and there was fierce competition and even fiercer undead in the big city. They'd been forced underground to the subway tunnels, a home unbefitting such a proud and once-strong clan.</seg>

They needed fuel for the trip - a lot of it. He pointed out three gas stations that might still have it. They also needed auto parts, spare tires and tools. Malik wrote down the names of two auto workshops in [CityName].

So we have 5 places to search. It's a lot of work, but Malik says the Riffs will repay us big-time if we do it all.</seg>

[We] couldn't find any decent materials to rebuild them and made several trips back to the fort for supplies. When it seemed done, I took the first trip up them, and had to leap free when the entire structure collapsed under me.

This whole thing was a massive waste of time. If we try again, we should send somebody who knows a bit more about construction next time.</seg>

Upstairs, [we] found [ourselves] looking at a treasure trove of old and exotic car parts, and premium fluids needed for all sorts of collector's models.

They were members of the Last Judgment Gang, using the station as a refueling stop while they were passing through. They called out: "Look what we have here. A little stray kitty crawling out of the alley. What can we do for you little alley cat?"

He was still lucid enough to make a fight or flight choice when the undead came for him. From the stain on the car roof four floors below, [we]'ve got a good idea of how the 'flight' went for him.

I dug through the clothes and found a softbound book titled _Alouatta Seniculus_ by Dr van Nooten. It's a study on some kind of South American monkey. The margins are filled with scribbled notes, drawings of brains and repeated phrases in Dutch and English. They used four different colored highlighters.</seg>

He came to let us know that if we ever want a pick-me-up, we should talk to them. According to him, you won't find a better supplier of mood-altering chemicals.

Which is probably true, since most of their competition is long since dead, either at the hands of zombies or another gang.</seg>

The building is owned by the Pharmacists. They're a loose organization of thugs and hipsters with a seriously anarchist streak, and they make some of the most potent drugs you can still get.

They'd be happy to sell us some of their product should we want any. Our scouts sure enjoyed it.</seg>

They're pig farmers. Seems they were able to shore up their farm pretty quickly when the dead started to rise. With plenty of meat on hand they haven't had to scavenge for food like the rest of us.

Maybe they'd be willing to trade for some of that meat? From their waistlines it looks like they've been eating like kings.</seg>

        <seg>The thing about a meat cleaver is it's already made to go through flesh and bone, so when you turn it into an impromptu weapon half of the work's done for you.

Cleavers are the favorite tool of the Pig Farmers. They're a group of butchers who own a sizable farm nearby. With their seemingly endless supply of food, they've done a lot better out here than most of us.

We should see if they'll trade us some of their tasty meat. I just hope they clean their blades between cutting up zed and carving up pork.</seg>

Word is they're a friendly if strange lot. A passing survivor mentioned being invited into their heavily-walled compound for dinner (mmm pork), but we haven't heard from anyone who's taken them up on it.

Maybe we should visit their farm and see if we get the same offer. I mean, if there's plenty of food to go round in there, maybe they'd be up for sharing a bite?</seg>

        <seg>School is where kids belong. There's a reason we've been using them for centuries.

We're going to take turns teaching them for now, the same way we handle nightly guard duty. Not sure which is worse... but most of us are probably better suited to the latter. We'll assign them lots of reading and homework to try to keep them busy. Hopefully worrying about schoolwork will keep their minds off the horrors outside.</seg>

        <seg>I don't mean to be all "Damn kids get off my lawn!" about this, but these kids really don't get the idea of being seen but not heard. They're always running around bugging adults who need to work, and if you tell them to get lost they do, literally, and need to be rescued.

This is what school used to be for, to keep them occupied for 8 hours a day so parents could have a break. Maybe we should re-institute them?</seg>

        <seg>I spent the afternoon organizing a timetable for guard duty that gives everyone three shifts a week with a maximum of four hours per watch. I based it on the traditional two-section dogged watch of the British Royal Navy, adjusted to account for conflicting daytime duties. I think everyone will agree my schedule is fair and balanced, and quite the thing of beauty.

People are going to complain, especially those with no real skill at defense, but we'll be more secure with their eyes on watch.</seg>

Others think the government should collect and distribute _all_ goods. Everything shared, and distributed to those who need it the most. That might work on a small scale, but can we run a society on those principles?

"We wanted to see the pigs," [Name] told me, "but they wouldn't let us near the barn. Instead they kept asking if we wanted a tour of the slaughterhouse. Damn creepy people."

Whoever those people were, they've left the [square]. Hopefully we won't run into them again.

[He] explained, between sobs, that [he]'d spotted [his] [father|mother|brother|sister] among the undead on the other side of our wall.

        <seg>There used to be a local martial arts school here called the Granville Riffs. They were known for their strict training regime and even stricter code of honor. But this wasn't the kind of self-defense class you'd send your seven year old to. These guys trained to kill with fists, feet, sticks and swords.

The nice thing about a sword is, it never runs out of bullets.

It looks like all that training paid off as the Riffs are still alive and kicking. We spotted a group of them set up nearby. Guess we should pay them a visit.</seg>

        <seg>We ran into these martial artists today called the Granville Riffs. It's like they walked straight out of a 70's kung fu movie with those yellow and black pajamas, but it's tough to be critical of anyone that heavily armed.

Those weapons weren't just for show. While we were chatting a zombie wandered over and one of those Riffs [put a shuriken through it's eye and into it's brain from 30 paces|split it clean in two from head to toe with her sword|stick his clawed-glove things into the zed's head and tear it clean off].

        <seg>We've been hearing some odd stories from passing survivors. They've run into what look like zombies around a nearby subway station. Except the strange zombies don't attack, they just cry and shuffle off.

We should probably look into this, but I'm sure as hell not volunteering to go into that subway station alone.</seg>

        <seg>Jesse and some Rotten came to visit today. The [*little girl with a ponytail and a single eye|one-armed, no-legged old man on a skateboard|fridge-shaped guy missing most of his face] was a bit unnerving, but they said they came to promote a peaceful co-existence between man and undead. Or as Jesse put it, to "have a lil' git ta know ya."

They boosted morale with their good cheer and handmade [*sock puppets|bouquets of sewer lichen|(but suspiciously green) pastries]. One Rotten woman insisted on shaking everyone's hand until her own fell off.</seg>

        <seg>A few of us went over to the Rotten encampment last night to watch them put on a Shakespeare play. It's one in a series of events Jesse set up to improve human-undead relations and "help all us folks git along" as he put it.

It was a unique interpretation, and we all laughed when [*Yorick's head started talking back to Hamlet|Julius Caesar got back up with Brutus' dagger in his back and kicked his butt|Juliet bit Romeo's lower lip right off during a passionate kiss]. Good fun and a nice boost to morale.</seg>

I kind of hated to do it to the guy, but he's wrong to believe so blindly without questioning some of the stuff written in that book of his. And he's double wrong to preach it to others instead of letting them come to their own conclusions.

In the end he admitted that at least we did know a lot about religion, and he respects that.</seg>

Sounds like Mason Moon and his Last Judgment friends have taken to dangerous stunts, herding zed around the city with their motorcycles. _"Foolish cheeldren,"_ Gustav commented, _"Dey will be killed."_

I'm not fond of this kid, but Diane asked me to look after her son when she died. They were last seen heading to an old hospital swarming with undead. Might send someone to check up on them.</seg>

Yes, _that_ Diane Moon. The woman who saved my life and gave it a purpose. The woman whose death I'm responsible for. She was Mason's mother.

        <seg>So long as we've got God on our side, we can't lose. All we've got to do is pray harder and longer than the other guys, and we'll win.

And if we don't win, that's because God's got another plan for us. So long as we trust Him, we'll survive.

And if we don't survive, God's got a reason for that too. We aren't seeing the big picture.

Okay, I think I've got this priest thing down. Grab me a pulpit, I'm ready!</seg>

        <seg>I admit the housing market's gone through a little deflation recently. A nice two-bedroom is going for what, a pack of smokes these days?

But Father O'Grady knows the value of territory, and of developing that territory for maximum profit. A park isn't worth much, but if it's got good soil you can convert it to a potato farm. You turn old office buildings into housing, and build lookout towers on tall buildings.

Listen to me, I sound like a regular real estate developer.</seg>

If we attack or raid the Last Judgment now, we'll catch them while most of their defenders are away. We could take them down in one swoop. We have one week until they return.</seg>

        <seg>Rufus and a couple of young St. Michael's School boys came around, wistfully peeking over the walls at our bar. They asked if there was any way we'd could slip them a beer... or six, or twelve. They said they'd give us their "totally rad" Bazooka in trade for some.

These kids are 12 years old, 13 at best - far too young to be drinking... right? Though I noticed they aren't too young to have pistols on their hips.</seg>

Rufus turned over the "Bazooka" to us... which turned out to be the name of a 12 year old bulldog they'd found. The old beast still has a little fight in her, but mostly all she does is sleep, snore loudly, and fart.

        <seg>Two of our guys got ambushed by a group of boys in school uniforms today. They had hilarious improvised weapons: socks full of quarters, dull swords made from fan-blades, and modded Nerf guns that shot real darts.

They were kids from an old-fashioned boarding school called St. Michael's, where they're fending for themselves now that the teachers are gone.

They let our guys go, but warned us to be careful around their school unless we want a dart or two in the butt. Ouch.</seg>

Not sure what happened to all the teachers though. Sounds like only the kids are left. We can try asking the boys about that if we send someone to trade.</seg>

The senator glared at both of us. "The soldiers need controlled conditions, " she said. "Now if you'll excuse us, I have something to discuss with Dr. Whyte here, which is _also_ none of your business, citizen."</seg>

"This is classified information Dr. Whyte, " she said. "Not something average citizens need to know."

To avoid any further "distractions", the senator ordered a soldier to escort [us] out.</seg>

"Chapter 3, Article 8b of the UN Charter states that any individuals infected by zombieism are no longer classified as human and retain no rights or privileges as such."

Unfortunately by that point the Zed had finished their meal downstairs and were starting to wander the rest of the house. I bolted, but slipped halfway down the trellis and twisted my ankle.

Then a zombie jumped out the window after me and chased me through the city for an hour at hobbling-speed. It hurt.</seg>

Sweat wouldn't stop dripping down the back of my neck as I went from room to room, but I made quick work of the search and soon found Chuck's passport in a side table.

The bad part came as I hit the bottom of the stairs and stepped on some broken glass from one of the windows, catching the attention of the Zed in the other room. Fortunately I can be quite the sprinter when I need to be, so everything worked out in the end.</seg>

        <seg>The Rotten went into hiding as soon as we got near, so we only caught a few today. One was an older Rotten named Two-Arms Reginald. It seemed he'd lost his other arm while we were chasing him, the one he usually carries around, and was whimpering pathetically about it. I felt sorry for him, but there are so many arms lying in any given street, I have no idea which might be his.

This should be enough for the Government, and anyway these guys are on to us.</seg>

        <seg>When [we] met with Jesse, he told [us] a story of a young girl who'd been bitten and locked in a closet by her parents who didn't have the heart to kill her. Jesse found her three weeks later, terrified, half-mad, but still alive.

"The disease changes us, " he said. "But our hearts still thump and our heads still think... well mostly. "

"Not that most of these folk carry ID any more. But Chuck... Chuck was a local. He had a place right here in [CityName]." He pointed us to an unclaimed suburban area. "Might find his papers there, if anywhere."</seg>

        <seg>The most important part of first aid training is CPR. But nobody could agree on the "right" way to do it. Five pumps on the chest then two breaths, or was it seven pumps and five breaths?

Then people worried about catching STDs from giving mouth to mouth so they took the breathing part right out. Then victims started suing their rescuers for accidentally breaking ribs, and hell what's the point of even trying.

The one rule is: act. Do something, _anything_ and you might save a life.</seg>

Could have cured malaria if we'd kept spraying mosquitoes with the stuff. Could have saved a hundred million lives if we weren't so scared of the possible side effects.

This pesticide we just finished developing is way worse for us, but we've got much more real things to be scared of. Funny how starvation changed everyone's point of view on stuff like organic food and gm crops. Who the hell cares.</seg>

Hiding behind their walls, squirreling away resources for winter. Living like pathetic grubs. We couldn't help ourselves. Just watching them scurry about the city was enough to make you want to scream.

So today we decided to give them a spontaneous little lesson. Show them how easily their fragile little walls could fall.</seg>

They brought me to the Government base to meet with Senator Davis. She could have just asked me to visit...

"I think it's time we put this war to an end." she said. "We have a common goal after all; distributing that new cure of yours. I hear you've finally worked out the kinks."

A pretty snide comment considering she might have been responsible for putting those kinks there in the first place.</seg>

After hours of paperwork detailing the conditions of our cease-fire, I still don't know about these guys. Were they just opportunists who saw the Omegavirus as a way to stronger, better soldiers?

The difference is, the Rotten are more likely to invite you in to tea than pluck your eyes from your skull. Well, mostly.

Their leader, Jesse, met us outside the Rotten's encampment, looking as grizzled as ever and chewing on some tobacco with his few remaining teeth. We exchanged the standard noncommittal nods and grunts of greeting.</seg>

"Could be," he said. "Used to be a young man by the name of Kevin Clark who sported such duds. Like the rest of us Rotten, he didn't he lose his mental-type faculties when he was bit. Least I assume he was just as much of a saddle-sore before as he was after."</seg>

I got a good look in her eyes before I killed her. No signs of intelligence there. But tool-using zombies are a terrifying thought. I hope we don't see more.</seg>

        <seg>I figured as soon as we got a water treatment plant in the fort [*I could stop collecting rainwater from the gutters every time I wanted a cup of tea|I'd be able revel in the ecstasy of a having a toilet that actually flushes], but no such luck. The plant's busted and it's going to take some effort and a bunch of building materials to get it working again.

If we've got a clever engineer or two we can spare, we might just be able to experience the joys of indoor plumbing once again.</seg>

        <seg>Who knew plumbing would be this complicated? Sure, having a water treatment plant in the fort is a good start, but that thing hasn't been running in ages, on account of [*all the body parts blocking up the pipes|the 'backlog' of waste that built up over the years].

We need the time of a few engineers and any building materials we've got to spare if we want to get the thing running again.</seg>

We can probably get the thing working again, but it won't be easy. It's going to take our best engineers and plenty of gear before anything liquid flows through those pipes again.</seg>

        <seg>These roaming zed seem to know how to use weapons... sort of. They can bash things with rocks or pieces of wood anyway, which is what happened to [Name] when they caught [him] out [missioning].

The only reason [he]'s still alive is that they didn't bite [him] instead.</seg>

        <seg>Something's different about this group of zombies at the [square]. They seem smarter... not like people though, it's an animal cunning, like wolves hunting in a pack. They don't go straight for us, but kind of circle around, looking for easier targets.

They nearly cornered [FormalName] who was [missioning] there. We had to cancel that from now, it's far too dangerous right now.</seg>

        <seg>These roaming zombie packs are more dangerous simply from their unpredictability. Like the ghosts from Pac-Man, some of them go straight for you, while others circle around and try to get you from behind. Some of them seem to move randomly, changing targets or even seeming to get bored in the middle of an attack.

We had to stop [missioning] at the [square]; it's far too dangerous to be around these things.</seg>

We saw a group of these stick-wielding zombies heading to the [square] and booked it. [Missioning] will have to wait until later.</seg>
