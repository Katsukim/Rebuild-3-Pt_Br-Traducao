# 1. Get visited by group of Judgment bikers, one asked about his mother. Said he heard you knew her. You take him aside and talk, but are cagey about what happened to her. All options go to _end after being displayed
# reporter is the main leader
sonIntro_title= Mason Moon
sonIntro_picture= gateGroup
sonIntro_pictureColin= mason
sonIntro= Some Last Judgment bikers just pulled up, their bikes airbrushed with elaborate crosses and scantily clad angels. One of them, a kid maybe 19 or 20 years old named Mason, came to ask about a woman named Diane Moon.\n\n
Yes, _that_ Diane Moon. The woman who saved my life and gave it a purpose. The woman whose death I'm responsible for. She was Mason's mother.\n\n
I pulled Mason aside before anyone else could talk to him, but I couldn't bring myself to admit the truth...
sonIntro_option1= Say she left on a trip
sonIntro_option2= Say she joined another group
sonIntro_option3= Say she went missing
sonIntro_outcome1= I told him that after she'd helped me out, Diane had left to hunt the region for other survivors. She left well armed and supplied, but I hadn't heard from her in a while.\n\n
Mason was frustrated that I couldn't tell him more, but before he could press me on it we were interrupted by sounds of crashing and angry voices.
sonIntro_outcome1_option1= Investigate...
sonIntro_outcome2= I told him that after helping us get started she'd joined up with another group of survivors to help them do the same. I wasn't sure where they were now, but she had seemed fine when last I saw her.\n\n
Mason was frustrated that I couldn't tell him more, but before he could press me on it we were interrupted by sounds of crashing and angry voices.
sonIntro_outcome2_option1= Investigate...
sonIntro_outcome3= I told him I didn't know where she was now. She just vanished late one night months back. There hadn't been any sign of a struggle, but given how bad things were out there we had eventually given up hope of finding her.\n\n
Mason was frustrated that I couldn't tell him more, but before he could press me on it we were interrupted by sounds of crashing and angry voices.
sonIntro_outcome3_option1= Investigate...
# 2. immediately after 1
sonIntroHoodlums= The other Judgment boys were causing trouble already. They'd cornered [Name] and were trying to get [him] to give up [his] jacket, saying it was "way too nice for such a scrawny little rat".\n\n
A crowd was gathering and both sides were starting to reach for their weapons. Mason eyed his fellow gang members worryingly but didn't try to break things up.\n\n
The only way we're going to avoid bloodshed here is if I give him a little nudge.
sonIntroHoodlums_option1= Demand he do something
sonIntroHoodlums_option2= Make a snarky remark
# -2 respect
sonIntroHoodlums_outcome1= Mason turned on me angrily, and for a second it looked like I'd just made things worse. Then he yelled at his gang mates: "Diggs! Gnasher! Hey guys, leave [him] alone. We're still in trouble with Father O'Grady from the last time."\n\n
As he got on his bike, Mason looked back at me and nodded. "Thanks for the info about my mom. Just... never try to tell me what to do." He spun out in a wide arc then drove off in a cloud of dust and exhaust fumes.
sonIntroHoodlums_outcome2= "Your friends seem nice," I told Mason sarcastically, "real stand-up individuals."\n\n
He sighed, then called out: "Diggs! Gnasher! Hey guys, this isn't why we're here! It's time to go anyway."\n\n
He apologized as they were leaving, saying the Last Judgment were supposed to be following the Word of God, but sometimes they forget the whole 'Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you' part.\n\n
It's good to know at least one of these bikers has a bit of a conscience.

# 3. after trading with Gustav any time after 1+2
# make a quest mission available on a dangerous hospital
sonGustav_title= Causing Trouble
sonGustav_picture= [FactionBackground]
sonGustav_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
sonGustav_pictureColin2= false
sonGustav= As Gustav and I shared a couple warm non-alcoholic beers, he mentioned some young bikers causing trouble in [CityName].\n\n
Sounds like Mason Moon and his Last Judgment friends have taken to dangerous stunts, herding zed around the city with their motorcycles. _"Foolish cheeldren,"_ Gustav commented, _"Dey will be killed."_\n\n
I'm not fond of this kid, but Diane asked me to look after her son when she died. They were last seen heading to an old hospital swarming with undead. Might send someone to check up on them.

# 4. Go to hospital, find son and Judgment trapped by zed. Can take a few different ways to rescue them.
# reporter is mentionedcolin and may get injured
sonHospital_title= Rescuing Mason Moon
sonHospital_picture= hospital
sonHospital_pictureColin= false
sonHospital_pictureColin2= false
sonHospital= [We] thought [we] [were] too late when [we] saw their bikes lying abandoned on the pavement, but [we] soon heard growls and gunfire coming from inside the hospital.\n\n
Carefully following the noise without making any more, [we] found Mason's crew barricaded in an operating room on the third floor. A dozen or more zed clawed at the doors in a frenzied hunger for flesh.\n\n
[We] need a plan to give the Judgment boys a chance to escape.
sonHospital_option1= Fight the zombies
sonHospital_option2= Try to lure the zed away
sonHospital_option3= Look for something to use
# roll against defense 15, on success gain +5 respect, fail has no penalty
sonHospital_option1_success= I charged into the horde, taking out four before they even reacted. As the dead whirled [we] fell upon them and soon the hallway was awash in putrefied blood.\n\n
As [we] led the Last Judgment crew back to their bikes, Mason seemed impressed by the trail of gore [we] left behind us.
sonHospital_option1_success_option1= Continue...
sonHospital_option1_fail= [We] charged into the pack of zed took down a couple of them quickly, but as the fight dragged on more undead began to shamble out of the waiting rooms and offices attracted by the noise.\n\n
[We] might have been totally overrun if Mason and his boys hadn't joined the fight. With their help [we] [were] able to hold zed back long enough to make [our] way downstairs and out of the hospital.
sonHospital_option1_fail_option1= Continue...
# roll 50/50, nothing on success, injury on fail
sonHospital_option2_success= All it took was a cry and a few jumping jacks and soon enough [we] [were] running as fast as [we] could through the hallways of the hospital, a pack of ravenous undead at [our] heels.\n\n
I noticed a place where the roof leaked and the floor under it was sagging. I leapt over the patch, and second later the ground gave way under the zombies behind me. [We] left them lying in a pile of rubble one floor down and made our way outside. Mason was waiting for [us].
sonHospital_option2_success_option1= Continue...
sonHospital_option2_fail= Getting the zed's attention was easy. Losing it was a lot harder. [We]'d been sprinting through the hallways chased by the pack of ravenous undead for fifteen minutes when I heard a cracking noise and the hallway gave way beneath my feet.\n\n
I lay painfully on my back in the mess for a minute before Mason's hand grabbed me and pulled me out of the rubble. Together we ran from the hospital as fast as my crippled spine allowed.
sonHospital_option2_fail_option1= Continue...
# roll against scavenging 1 (any scavenging), nothing on success, -5 respect on fail
sonHospital_option3_success= Hunting through a storeroom I found several compressed oxygen tanks. [We] lined them up at the end of the hallway like a firing squad, then picked up a brick and began to knock the tops off.\n\n
The canisters sped down the hallway, bouncing off floors, walls and zed, leaving a trail of broken bodies in their wake. [We] finished off the remaining undead and cleared Mason and his crew a path out of the hospital.
sonHospital_option3_success_option1= Continue...
sonHospital_option3_fail= As [we] hunted in the side rooms fruitlessly for anything to use I tripped and knocked over an IV stand into a nearby glass cabinet. Oops.\n\n
The chase that followed would have been perfect set to some Benny Hill music as we darted from room to room ahead of the zombies. Eventually we lost them and made our way out of the hospital to find Mason and his crew waiting for us, smirks on their faces.
sonHospital_option3_fail_option1= Continue...
# 5. all continues from 4 lead here
sonHospitalSupplies_pictureColin= mason
sonHospitalSupplies= Mason grinned at [us], exhilarated by the thrill of escape. He thanked [us] for [our] help, shaking my hand and hugging me, until one of his Last Judgment friends stepped between us and shoved Mason away. "What the _hell_ Mason. You know we didn't need their help. God woulda provided, man. You know that."\n\n
"Uh... yeah." Mason straightened up, but he didn't sound so sure. As we parted ways, he said we should come visit him at the Last Judgment fort sometime.

# 6. after meeting with the last judgment
sonFistfight_title= Meeting with Mason
sonFistfight_picture= [FactionBackground]
sonFistfight_pictureColin= mason
sonFistfight_pictureColin2= false
sonFistfight= I bumped into Mason Moon at the Last Judgment fort. He was hard to miss, since he was in the middle of a fistfight with two other guys. I think they were his friends from earlier - Bebop and Rocksteady? Something like that.
sonFistfight_option1= Pull the other gang members off him
sonFistfight_option2= Yell at everyone to stop
sonFistfight_option3= Wait and watch
# results in injury
sonFistfight_outcome1= I stepped in and accidentally joined the fray. I pinned one guy's arms behind him, then the other one kicked me in the back and knocked us both over. I stood up just in time to get punched right in the nose, which sent me sprawling. When my eyes could focus again I looked up to see who'd done it and was surprised to find a smallish young woman offering to help me up.\n\n
"Sorry, " she said, "I though you were another one of Mason's asshat friends."
sonFistfight_outcome1_option1= Get up
sonFistfight_outcome2= Only Mason looked over at me, successfully distracted just long enough to get punched in the face. Oops.\n\n
Then this smallish young woman came storming out of the gathering crowd. "Enough you idiots!" she shouted, brandishing a knife in their faces. "Back off, or I'll cut your ugly mugs up so bad they'll think you're a zombie."\n\n
Remarkably they did walk away, eyeing her angrily.
sonFistfight_outcome2_option1= What was that all about?
sonFistfight_outcome3= Mason seemed to be holding his own, moving around between lunges so that neither of them could get behind him. A crowd gathered, then suddenly this smallish young woman came storming into the fray. "Enough you idiots!" she shouted, brandishing a knife in their faces. "Back off, or I'll cut your ugly mugs up so bad they'll think you're a zombie."\n\n
Remarkably they did walk away, eyeing her angrily.
sonFistfight_outcome3_option1= What was that all about?
# all three options lead here
sonFistfightTalk_pictureColin2= erica
sonFistfightTalk= "It's my fault," the woman explained. "Mason's having trouble fitting in around here, so I told him the next time they pick on him to start a fight. It usually works for me."\n\n
The girl's name was Erica, another young initiate to the Last Judgment Gang. She and Mason had joined together a little over six months ago, but neither was making any friends.\n\n
"The women aren't allowed to ride bikes, " Erica complained, "they make us cook and clean the chapel all day. And I hate Bible study."
sonFistfightTalk_option1= Ask why don't they leave?
sonFistfightTalk_outcome1= Mason poked his finger at me. "Because the Last Judgment Gang are way badder asses than _your_ group. We've got the power of righteousness on our side." Erica nodded her agreement. "Plus, Father O'Grady saved our lives when he found us." she said more quietly.\n\n
Seems like there's no getting through to these two.

# 7. a week later, Mason is discovered in the fort
# can happen even if you are at war with last judgment
sonStowaway_title= Last Judgment Stowaways
sonStowaway_picture= shed
sonStowaway_pictureColin= mason
sonStowaway_pictureColin2= erica
sonStowaway= I was in one of our storerooms, obsessively counting and recounting of our food stocks as I do sometimes when I can't sleep. I heard a noise and jumped up in time to catch Mason Moon and his friend Erica from the Last Judgment Gang trying to sneak past me.\n\n
They swear they didn't steal anything, they were just looking for a place to sleep. Erica got in some trouble with the Last Judgment and they're now on the run.
sonStowaway_option1= Ask them what happened
sonStowaway_option2= Let them stay and have some food
sonStowaway_option3= Turn them in to the Last Judgment Gang
sonStowaway_outcome1= Apparently Erica had made good on her threat to cut the face off any Last Judgment boy who touched her. A couple of them snuck into her room one night; now one is missing an eye and the other a nose.\n\n
"They'll kill me if I go back, " she said, "Father O'Grady would never take my side. That's not how things work there. I can't stay in [CityName] with the Last Judgment so close."
sonStowaway_outcome1_option1= Offer to destroy the Last Judgment
sonStowaway_outcome1_option2= Offer to sneak them out of town
sonStowaway_outcome1_option3= Turn them in to the Last Judgment Gang
# minus 2 food, same as above
sonStowaway_outcome2= They were grateful for our hospitality and told their story over dinner. Apparently Erica had made good on her threat to cut the face off any Last Judgment boy who touched her. A couple of them snuck into her room one night; now one is missing an eye and the other a nose.\n\n
"They'll kill me if I go back, " she said, "Father O'Grady would never take my side. That's not how things work there. I can't stay in [CityName] with the Last Judgment so close."
sonStowaway_outcome2_option1= Offer to destroy the Last Judgment
sonStowaway_outcome2_option2= Offer to sneak them out of town
sonStowaway_outcome2_option3= Turn them in to the Last Judgment Gang
# all "turn them in" go here
# +5 food and materials, and +10 respect, end of questline
sonStowawayTurnIn_picture= [FactionBackground]
sonStowawayTurnIn_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
sonStowawayTurnIn= Whatever they did, it was up to Father O'Grady and the Last Judgment Gang to decide their punishment. We dragged them kicking and screaming back to the Last Judgment fort where O'Grady thanked us for our help.\n\n
"She nearly killed two of our boys," he said, "and will be dealt with accordingly. The Good Book has it very clear what her punishment should be."\n\n
He gave us a small reward and an ominous warning to "stay off the devil's path".
# all sneak them out go here
sonStowawaySneak= Erica and Mason weren't thrilled with our disguise for them: we drove them out of town under dried blood crusted sheets, pretending they were dead bodies being taken for cremation in an outlying graveyard. If the Last Judgment saw us go, they didn't stop us to ask questions.\n\n
The two thanked us for our help and wished us the best of luck. I hope they'll be okay out there...
# all offer to destroy the last judgement go here
sonStowawayDestroy= Mason guffawed at this. "Attack _them_? Have you _seen_ the kind of firepower they're packing? You guys wouldn't stand a chance, it'd be like a lame dog attacking a herd of elephants. And you're the lame dog in this situation in case you didn't know."\n\n
I was getting ready to smack him upside the head when he added:\n\n
"Although... there _is_ that pilgrimage to Angel Acres they're heading off to for the next week...."
# visible until it is chosen
sonStowawayDestroy_option1= What about this pilgrimage?
# only visible if the dahlias are on the map and met, visible until it is chosen
sonStowawayDestroy_option2= Maybe someone could help us?
sonStowawayDestroy_outcome1= Mason explained that the Last Judgment leaders, along with their highest-ranking and best-armed priests, were heading to a rally in a place called Angel Acres. Father O'Grady was expecting some sort of miracle or message from God to appear there.\n\n
If we attack or raid the Last Judgment now, we'll catch them while most of their defenders are away. We could take them down in one swoop. We have one week until they return.
sonStowawayDestroy_outcome2= Erica suggested we could try the Dahlias. They hate the Last Judgment Gang anyway. If we let them know that the gang's going to be weaker soon while their leaders are off at that religious rally or whatever, maybe they'll join us in the raid.\n\n
"Also the Dahlias are pretty badass," Mason just had to inject, "you guys might learn a thing or two."

# agreed to attack last judgment but failed to do it in time
sonTooLate_title= Too Late
sonTooLate_picture= [FactionBackground]
sonTooLate_pictureColin= false
sonTooLate_pictureColin2= false
sonTooLate= We failed to attack the Last Judgment Gang while they were away at Angel Acres. Their people have returned and defenses are back to normal again. We missed our chance.\n\n
Mason and Erica were disappointed with us and left town. Hopefully they'll be alright out there.

# 8. when meeting with the dahlias, make asking them to join optional since it's a tradeoff
sonDahlias_title= Our Mutual Enemy
sonDahlias_picture= [FactionBackground]
sonDahlias_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
sonDahlias_pictureColin2= false
sonDahlias= Nell McClung was in a good mood when I met with her today, humming while she came down the stairs to greet me. We spoke in the expansive, blindingly white foyer of the mansion that served as the Dahlias HQ. I guess everyone could live in a place like this if we wanted to now, but who has the energy to clean this thing?
sonDahlias_option1= Ask them to attack Last Judgment
sonDahlias_option2= Say nothing
sonDahlias_outcome1= She smiled wide when I suggested we team up against the Last Judgment Gang. "Yes," she agreed, "It's time we finally dealt with that _element_."\n\n
We moved to the living room and unfolded a map of [CityName] onto the coffee table. She suggested an aggressive simultaneous attack against as many points as possible. When I suggested she'd be spreading her forces too thin, she laughed.\n\n
"You haven't seen my girls at work. Just make sure you attack while the Last Judgment leaders are still away, and we'll be there."
sonDahlias_outcome2= I complimented Ms. McClung on the decor. She replied that white is a wonderful color, because you can just bleach the blood right out of it so easily. We made somewhat awkward small talk for a few minutes after that.

# 9. after attacking last judgment on the correct day (maybe +/- one day to be kind)
# if on the right day, last judgment is destroyed & you (or dahlias) take over their fort
sonDestroy_title= Our Mutual Enemy
sonDestroy_picture= [FactionBackground]
sonDestroy_pictureColin= false
sonDestroy_pictureColin2= false
sonDestroy= Father O'Grady was away as promised when we attacked their fort. It seems he'd taken their best soldiers with him, or at least their best guns. The kids left behind to guard the place had nothing but pistols and knives to defend with.\n\n
When it was clear they were losing, the last defenders jumped on their motorcycles and took off.\n\n
Mason and Erica cheered and high-fived at this.
sonDestroy_option1= Invite the couple to stay
sonDestroy_option2= Wish the couple well
# replace with this if the dahlias are helping
# instant alliance with dahlias but they get the territory
sonDestroyDahlias= The Dahlias had nearly finished the job by the time we even got there. I guess they started early to make sure they got the glory. And/or the territory.\n\n
Father O'Grady was away as promised and the few guards left at home were badly armed. When it was clear they were losing, the last defenders jumped on their motorcycles and took off.\n\n
Mason and Erica cheered and high-fived at this.
sonDestroyDahlias_option1= Invite the couple to stay
sonDestroyDahlias_option2= Wish the couple well
# replace with this if we are too early or late
#sonDestroyWrong = Ooooh crap, we attacked the Last Judgment Gang on the wrong day. Father O'Grady and his best men were all there to fight us, and now that they're on to us, we lost any element of surprise. I guess we'll have to fight this war with them the old fashioned way.\n\n
#Mason and Erica were disappointed with us and left town. Hopefully they'll be alright out there.
# special colins Mason Moon and Erica Lee join (faces coming soon)
sonDestroy_outcome1= "Hah, no, we're not a 'couple'." Mason almost blushed. "We're a team, the two of us. I go where she goes. But I'm not really into girls like that, you know?"\n\n
They both agreed to join us. I don't know if we'll hear from Father O'Grady again after such a massive defeat, but the rest of the Last Judgment have vacated and their fort is now ours.
sonDestroy_outcome1_effect= Last Judgment destroyed
# replace with this if the dahlias helped, you don't get the couple
sonDestroyDahlias_outcome1= "Hah, no, we're not a 'couple'." Mason almost blushed. "We're a team, the two of us. I go where she goes. But I'm not really into girls like that, you know?"\n\n
They both seemed more interested in joining the Dahlias after watching them kick ass all day. "No offence," said Mason, "But they just really know what they're doing over there."\n\n
Looks like the Dahlias got the territory _and_ the spoils, but at least they've agreed to ally with us.
sonDestroyDahlias_outcome1_effect= Last Judgment destroyed, alliance with Dahlias
sonDestroy_outcome2= "Hah, no, we're not a 'couple'." Mason almost blushed. "We're a team, the two of us. I go where she goes. But I'm not really into girls like that, you know?"\n\n
The two seemed a little sad that we didn't ask them to join us, but we've got enough problems without these two getting into trouble at every turn. They salvaged a couple bikes from the Last Judgment fort and rode off into the sunset together.
sonDestroy_outcome2_effect= Last Judgment destroyed
# replace with this if dahlias helped
sonDestroyDahlias_outcome2= Hah, no, we're not a 'couple'." Mason almost blushed. "We're a team, the two of us. I go where she goes. But I'm not really into girls like that, you know?"\n\n
They both seemed interested in joining the Dahlias after watching them kick ass all day. "No offence," said Mason, "But they just really know what they're doing over there."\n\n
Looks like the Dahlias got the territory _and_ the spoils, but at least they've agreed to ally with us.
sonDestroyDahlias_outcome2_effect= Last Judgment destroyed, alliance with Dahlias

# award a perk at the end of this plotline no matter how it turned out
sonReward_title= On Fanaticism
sonReward_picture= church
sonReward_pictureColin= true
sonReward= I've got to hand it to those Last Judgment, they sure are passionate about what they believe in.\n\n
Though I'm not sure it's healthy for a young guy like Mason Moon to get caught up in their world, they could probably teach him something about commitment to a cause.\n\n
What I've learned from the Last Judgment is...
# all lead to the same next option
sonReward_option1= Might makes right
sonReward_option2= God is awesome
sonReward_option3= There's money in real estate
sonReward_option4= not a lot, actually
sonReward_outcome1= It's the law of the gangster: the strong thrive, and the weak don't survive. You can have all the intelligence, honor and wealth in the world, but if you can't defend yourself you'll be left with nothing.\n\n
The Last Judgment Gang know that power and aggression are connected. Sometimes you just have to bust caps in a few asses before people take you seriously.\n\n
It's an important lesson I'm glad to have learned.
sonReward_outcome1_effect= Gained the Gang Member perk
sonReward_outcome2= So long as we've got God on our side, we can't lose. All we've got to do is pray harder and longer than the other guys, and we'll win.\n\n
And if we don't win, that's because God's got another plan for us. So long as we trust Him, we'll survive.\n\n
And if we don't survive, God's got a reason for that too. We aren't seeing the big picture.\n\n
Okay, I think I've got this priest thing down. Grab me a pulpit, I'm ready!
sonReward_outcome2_effect= Gained the Priest perk
sonReward_outcome3= I admit the housing market's gone through a little deflation recently. A nice two-bedroom is going for what, a pack of smokes these days?\n\n
But Father O'Grady knows the value of territory, and of developing that territory for maximum profit. A park isn't worth much, but if it's got good soil you can convert it to a potato farm. You turn old office buildings into housing, and build lookout towers on tall buildings.\n\n
Listen to me, I sound like a regular real estate developer.
sonReward_outcome3_effect= Gained the Real Estate Developer perk
sonReward_outcome4= That Father O'Grady is so full of crap it's leaking out his pant-legs. Shooting his gun in the air while quoting scripture: what a hypocrite.\n\n
And a bully, too. No, I didn't learn anything from those bikers.

# meeting with luddies
fatherStart_title= Conspiracy Theories
fatherStart_picture= [FactionBackground]
fatherStart_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
fatherStart_pictureColin2= false
fatherStart= I was treated to that guy Ludd's rambling theories when I met with the Luddies today. He thinks the Center for Disease Control created zombieism as some kind of weapon in the US's secret cold war against China.\n\n
He also says a CDC scientist named Agbayani used to live right here in [CityName]. I remember hearing about that guy on the news a few weeks before the disease got here. He was wanted by the federal police and they offered a reward for his location.\n\n
It's too late for that reward, but this scientist might know about a cure, or at least have some answers.
fatherStart_option1= Encourage Ludd to keep talking
fatherStart_option2= Ignore Ludd
fatherStart_outcome1= Ludd leaned in close, his eyes bulging. "Zombieism was an inside job, man. You know how I _know_ they created it? Because Atlanta was hit first - that's the CDC headquarters."\n\n
He figures they created the disease to launch against China ("who we all know was breeding Smallpox"). Dr Agbayani's team was adapting it into a mind-control virus that would make people docile and complacent. He set it loose, and that's why the feds were after him.\n\n
"They were going to put it in the water, man. Turn us all into zombies. Ask that kid Rufus over at St Michael's. Agbayani was his dad."
fatherStart_outcome2= Ludd looked a little deflated but we got back to business. As I was leaving, he told me I should ask about Dr Agbayani at St Michael's. Said that kid Rufus is Agbayani's son.

# meeting with stmichaels
fatherRufus_title= Doctor Agbayani
fatherRufus_picture= [FactionBackground]
fatherRufus_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
fatherRufus_pictureColin2= false
fatherRufus= I met with Rufus, the leader of St Michael's School for Boys. If you ask me he's an arrogant little punk, but I guess I was fifteen once too.\n\n
I mentioned the stuff Ludd said about the kid's dad, Dr Agbayani. Rufus admitted his dad was a CDC researcher and said they used to live in the suburbs here, but swore Agbayani was a good guy and would never have helped create such a horrible disease. He also said he knew his dad was dead, but wouldn't say why.\n\n
He told me to drop the subject and stop worrying about a cure. "There ain't no cure old [man], just a lotta false hope."
fatherRufus_option1= Apologize to Rufus
fatherRufus_option2= Tell Rufus to grow a pair
fatherRufus_outcome1= I tried to say I was sorry, but Rufus refused to answer me and left. I saw him later with his eyes all red like he'd been crying. Poor kid.
fatherRufus_outcome2= Rufus sniffed and stuck his chin out. He said something like "Up yours, man" and we finished our business in silence.

# meeting with luddies again
fatherLuddiesAgain_title= It Rots Your Brain
fatherLuddiesAgain_picture= [FactionBackground]
fatherLuddiesAgain_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
fatherLuddiesAgain_pictureColin2= false
fatherLuddiesAgain= I ran into the Luddies today, and Owen Ludd was in full lecture mode. Today's topic: how TV and the Internet nearly destroyed our children. I made some dumb joke like "Thank god for zombies, eh?" which got his attention.\n\n
He knew we'd talked to that kid Rufus from St Michael's and wanted to know what we learned. "You don't believe him do you? I bet his dad's home office is full of documents that could prove what really happened. Maybe even tell us how to find a cure."\n\n
Ludd's got a point. He wants to come with us to investigate Rufus's old house in the suburbs. Should we do it?
fatherLuddiesAgain_option1= Yes, take Ludd to Rufus's old house
fatherLuddiesAgain_option2= No, leave well enough alone
fatherLuddiesAgain_outcome1= Great. Except we don't know where Rufus's old house is, only that it's somewhere in [CityName]. We'll have to convince the kid to tell us how to find it.
fatherLuddiesAgain_outcome2= We should have some respect for the kid's dead family and just let them lie. I guess we'll never know if Dr Agbayani was really the monster they made him out to be.

fatherRufusAgain_picture= [FactionBackground]
fatherRufusAgain_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
fatherRufusAgain_pictureColin2= luddies
fatherRufusAgain= Ludd and I met with Rufus Agbayani from St Michael's today, and asked if he could take us to look for his dad's old zombieism research. The look that kid gave me... well I think the answer was either _no_, or _go kiss a zombie and die_.\n\n
How can we persuade him?
fatherRufusAgain_option1= Convince Rufus (75 respect)
fatherRufusAgain_option2= Offer Rufus 20 food rations
fatherRufusAgain_option3= Ask Ludd to give him food (75 respect)
fatherRufusAgain_outcome1= Ludd cheerily explained his theory that Dr Agbayani had been developing zombieism as a mind-control weapon. Rufus went quiet for a minute while this news about his dad sank in. Then he let out a sudden cry like a wild animal and leapt on the guy.\n\n
After I pulled Rufus off and made sure he hadn't actually clawed Ludd's eyes out, I told him I didn't believe Ludd's theory but there was only one way to know for sure: go to his old home and find the evidence.\n\n
He agreed, gave directions to a house in the suburbs and said we could leave anytime.
fatherRufusAgain_outcome2Food= Rufus's eyes lit up at the mention of food. Come to think of it, the boys of St Michael's are looking more sunken-eyed and skinny than usual. We traded them 20 rations and Rufus agreed to take us. He gave directions to a house in the suburbs and said we could leave anytime.
fatherRufusAgain_outcome3NoFood= Rufus's eyes lit up at the mention of food. Come to think of it, the boys of St Michael's are looking more sunken-eyed and skinny than usual. I felt a bit sheepish that we didn't actually have 20 rations to give, but Ludd jumped in and said he'd pay the rest. I guess he noticed the kids were hungry too.\n\n
Rufus agreed, gave directions to a house in the suburbs and said we could leave anytime.
fatherRufusAgain_outcome3= I suggested Ludd offer the kids some corn and beets from the Luddie farms. Rufus's eyes lit up at the mention of food. Come to think of it, the boys of St Michael's are looking more sunken-eyed and skinny than usual. Ludd must have noticed too because he quickly agreed.\n\n
Rufus accepted the food, gave directions to a house in the suburbs and said we could leave anytime.

# finished quest mission at house
fatherInvestigate_title= The Agbayani House
fatherInvestigate_picture= house
fatherInvestigate_pictureColin= stmichaels
fatherInvestigate_pictureColin2= luddies
fatherInvestigate= Owen Ludd and I followed Rufus to his old house in the suburbs. The two of them argued the whole way. Ludd accused Rufus of being helpless without the Internet to tell him how to do everything. Rufus called Ludd a patchouli-reeking old technophobe. They finally shut up when we got there.\n\n
Rufus said he hasn't been back to this house in two years, but the front door was ajar and there were scuffling noises coming from inside. Who should enter first?
fatherInvestigate_option1= Rufus - it's his house
fatherInvestigate_option2= Ludd - this was his idea
fatherInvestigate_option3= I'll go first
# {1} will be replaced by fatherInvestigateDoorRufus, -Ludd or -Me
fatherInvestigateDoor= {1}\n\n
Inside, a terrified dog sped around the room twice, hesitated as it saw we were blocking the exit, then zipped out through our legs. We breathed a sigh of relief: no zombies.\n\n
The house was starting to go a little mildewy, but Dr Agbayani's office was fine. We found a laptop with the CDC logo but that was about it. On our way out I noticed Rufus staring out the window at a corner of the backyard.
fatherInvestigateDoorRufus= You got to hand it to that kid, he's brave as all hell. He pulled out a huge hunting knife, howled like a crazed beast and kicked the door wide open.
fatherInvestigateDoorLudd= Ludd readied his shotgun and carefully pushed the door open.
fatherInvestigateDoorMe= I took out my weapon, wondered again how the heck I'd been talked into this mission, then pushed open the door.
fatherInvestigateDoor_option1= Talk to Rufus
fatherInvestigateDoor_option2= Leave him alone
fatherInvestigateDoor_outcome1= I didn't expect Rufus to say much, but he blurted out: "I buried him out there."\n\n
His dad had hung himself in the living room, probably thinking Rufus was dead. All his suicide note said was _I'm sorry_. Rufus said this was the story of his life: his mom died when he was young and his dad left him at boarding school while he flew around the world working on projects he couldn't talk about.\n\n
"He always had that laptop with him" Rufus told me, "he probably loved that thing more than me." Let's get it powered at a workshop and see what's on it.
fatherInvestigateDoor_outcome2= We're going to bring this laptop back so we can power it up at a workshop and find out what's on it.

# finish quest mission in workshop
fatherLaptop_title= CDC Reserach
fatherLaptop_picture= workshop
fatherLaptop_pictureColin1= luddies
fatherLaptop_pictureColin2= stmichaels
fatherLaptop= It was easy to power Dr Agbayani's laptop, but the CDC's security took time to bypass. Given enough time, anything can be cracked. Zombies know this; they'll smash at the same locked gate for a month if they smell meat on the other side.\n\n
We got Rufus and Ludd in for the unveiling. The kid looked fidgety. I think he's starting to believe Ludd's stories about his old man... that he created zombieism for the government and was planning to infect us from the start.\n\n
What words should we search for first?
fatherLaptop_option1= "origin", "creation", "weapon"
fatherLaptop_option2= "laboratory", "location", "address"
fatherLaptop_option3= "vaccine", "cure", "antiserum"
# only visible once the three above have been chosen
fatherLaptop_option4= Continue...
fatherLaptop_outcome1= We picked through cached emails and painfully technical research that went over our heads. One thing was clear: the government did not create this disease.\n\n
Dr Agbayani knew almost nothing about it at first, but spent the last months of his life frantically searching for a cure.
fatherLaptop_outcome2= The doctor made several references to something called the Hope Infectious Disease and Viral Experimention Laboratory. It's north of here in a town called Hope, across the border in Canada.\n\n
He called it "our best chance for a cure" and pleaded with his superiors to let him share the American CDC research with the scientists there. They rejected him.
fatherLaptop_outcome3= They never even got close to a cure. Dr Agbayani's emails grew increasingly frustrated, asking why they weren't sharing research with other countries. The answer was always "it's a matter of state security". His final email:\n\n
"We can't fight this thing without help, so I'm going public with my research. I hope you can forgive me. I hope they all forgive us for failing."\n\n
So, Dr Agbayani was a good man. No wonder the government was looking for him after he shared their private research with the world.
fatherLaptop_outcome4= Rufus was smiling through his tears by the end. His dad's desktop background was a picture of a younger, more innocent Rufus digging in the sand at the beach.\n\n
Ludd apologized but said this just proves it was China who created the disease.\n\n
We'll hold on to this research for now. It might turn out to be useful later.
fatherLaptop_outcome4_effect= Gained Dr Agbayani's research

# rufus comes to the fort
fatherStarving_title= Please sir...
fatherStarving_picture= gate
fatherStarving_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
fatherStarving_pictureColin2= false
fatherStarving= Rufus Agbayani and two other kids from St Michael's School for Boys came by our gates today. They looked badly malnourished. One of them was missing three of his front teeth, and I don't think those were baby teeth. Rufus apologized for not being honest earlier. The truth is they've scavenged all the food they can safely reach from their fort. The boys of St Michaels are starving.\n\n
Rufus was inspired by the Luddies' farming skills and wants to start a garden in the back field of their school. They came to see if we could help.
fatherStarving_option1= Feed the boys and promise help
fatherStarving_option2= Promise to send help if you can
fatherStarving_option3= Tell the snot-nosed kids to take a hike
fatherStarving_outcome1= The gap-toothed boy - I think his name was Curly - ate twice his weight in reconstituted mashed potatoes. Rufus was more solemn and respectful than I've ever seen him, but he pocketed extra bread rolls and deer jerky whenever he thought we weren't looking.\n\n
We agreed to bring the boys enough supplies to get their farm started. A shovel and ten loads of building material will do it. When we have enough, we should send someone over to St Michael's to deliver them.
fatherStarving_outcome2= We agreed to bring the boys enough supplies to get their farm started. A shovel and 10 armloads of building materials should do it. When we have enough we should send someone over to St Michael's to deliver them.
fatherStarving_outcome3= We can't just give everything we've worked so hard for away just because somebody asks nice. Those boys from St Michael's have to learn to do things for themselves if they want to survive.\n\n
I know I'm right and someday they'll thank us for it, but it still stung when Rufus called me a _fart-sniffing bubble butt_. Punk!

fatherSupplies_pictureColin2= false
fatherSupplies= [We] met Rufus at St Michael's with the tools to build a farm in the boarding school's overgrown garden. The kids grabbed shovels and started digging holes in random places, obviously no clue what they were doing.\n\n
I asked Rufus if they needed help. He got defensive said "Not from you. What the heck do _you_ know about farming?". I restrained myself from slapping the little goon.\n\n
Then he had the nerve to ask if we could convince the Luddies to come teach them to farm.
fatherSupplies_option1= Agree to talk to the Luddies
fatherSupplies_option2= Tell him we'll think about it
fatherSupplies_outcome1= Rufus looked relieved and said something like "Good, because the Luddies are the best farmers in [CityName], and St Michael's only has the _best_ teachers."\n\n
I tell you I had to bite my lip this time to stop from smacking the twit.
fatherSupplies_outcome2= Rufus said something sarcastic about not needing help from a bunch of old men anyway. He was defiant, but I caught the eye of one of the little ones who'd been listening in, his face already smeared with mud. His desperate, pleading expression convinced me we had to help these kids somehow.

fatherLuddiesTeach_pictureColin2= false
fatherLuddiesTeach= In Ludd's wood-paneled basement office we asked him to teach the boys at St Michael's a thing or two about growing their own food.\n\n
Ludd seemed sympathetic, or maybe he had indigestion from those weird black tomatoes-things they were growing outside. Said he'd like to help but they were already short-handed trying to keep their own walls from falling down. One of their best builders was out of commission with a gangrenous looking foot after stepping on a rusty nail.\n\n
"I might be able to help if we had a medkit for him..." Ludd waggled his eyebrows meaningfully.
# replace if we are returning
fatherLuddiesTeachAgain= I returned to Ludd to ask if he could teach the boys at St Michael's to grow their own food. He told me their injured builder had already lost his leg, but they could still use that medkit for next time.
fatherLuddiesTeach_option1= Appeal to his good nature (75 respect)
fatherLuddiesTeach_option2= Give him a medkit (medkit)
fatherLuddiesTeach_option3= Come back later
fatherLuddiesTeach_outcome1= Ludd finally relented and said he'd give the kids a few lessons himself, but only if they do exactly what they're told. He seemed to think I was keen to learn about farming too, and actually taught me a few tricks about natural pesticides that may come in handy.
fatherLuddiesTeach_outcome2= I gave Ludd the medkit. He agreed to give the kids a few lessons himself, but only if they do exactly what they're told. He seemed to think I was keen to learn about farming too, and actually taught me a few recipes for natural pesticides that may come in handy. No chemicals, poisons or bovine growth hormone, just clean living.
fatherLuddiesTeach_outcome3= We'll come back later with the medkit.

# rufus arrives at our gates, their school is overrun
fatherDisaster_title= School's Out
fatherDisaster_picture= gate2
fatherDisaster_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
fatherDisaster_pictureColin2= false
fatherDisaster= We heard a banging on our front gate and found Rufus there, covered in mud and out of breath. Seems one of the more clueless St Michael's kids took down a section of their fence to build a planter, and Zed poured through that hole just as soon as they found it.\n\n
There could be a hundred zombies in there now. It'd be dangerous to try to clear the school out, but we could at least rescue some of the boys. We don't have room for that many new mouths to feed, but the Luddies have plenty of food on their farm - maybe they'll adopt them.
fatherDisaster_option1= Send soldiers to clear out the zombies (dangerous)
fatherDisaster_option2= Safely rescue what kids we can
fatherDisaster_option3= Tell Rufus this isn't our problem
fatherDisaster_outcome1= You should have seen that kid's face light up. He told us he'd meet us there and hurried back. We've only got a few hours or maybe a day at best to gather a team and send them to St Michael's.\n\n
Don't know if we're going to be able make it over to the school in time, but we're damn well going to try.
fatherDisaster_outcome1_effect= Mission available to Save St Michael's

fatherDisaster_outcome2_pictureColin= false
fatherDisaster_outcome2_pictureColin2= false
fatherDisaster_outcome2= We rounded up those boys who made it out of the school. Amazingly most of them did, so at least those kids were good at something: being neither seen nor heard.\n\n
Around midnight the school caught fire and we watched it burn down. We took the kids to the Luddies' farm, where Owen said they could do with a few more hands. He made the kids toss their smart phones and gadgets - not that they could charge them anyway - but promised three square meals and sturdy walls.
fatherDisaster_outcome3_picture= fireBuilding
fatherDisaster_outcome3_pictureColin= false
fatherDisaster_outcome3_pictureColin2= false
fatherDisaster_outcome3= Rufus snarled and called us yellow-bellies, then burst into frustrated tears and ran off into the night.\n\n
Around midnight we saw smoke from the direction of St Michael's. As much as the kids hated that old brick building, they probably didn't want to be in it when it came down. Hopefully some of them got out alive...

# finished quest mission to fight zombies, always success
fatherFight_title= Bangarang!
fatherFight_picture= [FactionBackground]
fatherFight_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
fatherFight_pictureColin2= false
fatherFight= We headed to St Michael's to kick those damn Zed out of the school like an old torch-and-pitchfork mob. I didn't expect our guys to take it so literally. Turns out spearing a zombie on a pitchfork then setting it on fire with a torch is quite effective.\n\n
Despite the scorch marks, Rufus and the kids were so happy to have their school back that they declared us "Forever-Friends" on the spot and showered us with gifts. Rufus presented me with his favorite switchblade, a gift from his dad. Aw, shucks.

# did not start the quest mission to fight zombies in time

fatherFightExpired= We couldn't save St Michael's School for Boys in time. The few kids that got out of there headed over to the Luddies, and I think they're all a little miffed at us for failing to help.\n\n
Not sure what happened to Rufus... Last we saw was an explosion and the school roof collapsing in on itself. I wonder if that gutsy kid tried to take as many Zed as he could with him when he died.

I'd hoped the boy had survived the fire... I guess I'm glad to know he's alive out there somewhere. Maybe he'll find a way to start again someplace new.

fatherDenoument_title= Old Grievances
fatherDenoument_picture= [FactionBackground]
fatherDenoument_pictureColin= luddies
fatherDenoument_pictureColin2= stmichaels
fatherDenoument= Visited the Luddies farm and found Ludd and Rufus butting heads again.\n\n
Ludd was saying that relying too much on tech made people vulnerable and the reason they'd survived was 'cause they knew how to use their own two hands. Meanwhile Rufus was arguing that those hands were a lot more effective when they were using tools, and that's all tech was, an advanced tool.
fatherDenoument_option1= Side with Rufus
fatherDenoument_option2= Side with Ludd
fatherDenoument_option3= Tell them they're both idiots
fatherDenoument_outcome1= I told Ludd he should listen to the kid: there's nothing wrong with making the best use of what you can get. Rufus chuckled and gave me a fist bump, then slapped something into my hand - a little hand-crank radio. "Pops here just doesn't understand" he said and trotted off.\n\n
Ludd watched him go, annoyed, then his expression softened and he mouthed the word "Pops". I guess the guy's enjoying fatherhood, such as it is.
fatherDenoument_outcome2= I told Rufus that Ludd has a point: fancy tech doesn't mean much when you've got a world like this where you don't got nothing to build it on.\n\n
Ludd threw me a heavy sack of potatoes and said I knew what I was talking about. He smiled that broad grin of his and ruffled Rufus's hair in a way that made the kid bristle. Rufus looked like he was about to say something sarcastic, then thought better of it and smiled too.
fatherDenoument_outcome3= I told them they've both got a better chance to spot Zed coming if they got their heads out of their own backsides.\n\n
They looked a little taken aback... and then both of them broke into laughter. I think they're going to be alright.

# award a perk at the end of this plotline no matter how it turned out
fatherReward_title= On Fathers
fatherReward_picture= bedroom
fatherReward_pictureColin= true
fatherReward= All this thinking about StMicheals and the Luddies, sons and fathers, has me remembering my own childhood.\n\n
We moved around a lot and it was sometimes hard to make friends.\n\n
My father was...
# all lead to the same next option
fatherReward_option1= A proud military man
fatherReward_option2= Never around when we needed him
fatherReward_option3= Secretly a kindhearted softie
fatherReward_outcome1= And of course mom was always there to patch up a skinned knee or chase off neighborhood bullies. She was pretty rad. \n\nBut she and dad never understood my true passion, my obsession as a child. What I really wanted to be when I grew up was...
fatherReward_outcome1_option1= A Police Officer
fatherReward_outcome1_option2= A Gangster
fatherReward_outcome1_option3= A Rockstar
fatherReward_outcome1_option4= Just myself
fatherReward_outcome1_outcome1= I used to play elaborate games of cops and robbers involving forensic evidence and criminal profiling. But my parents thought it was too dangerous a career and forbid me from joining the force. Soon life swept me away and I forgot my childhood dream.\n\n
But nothing's stopping me now, so what the hell. I'm going to study and train, and transform myself into [CityName's] first chief of police.\n\n
I think if they were still around, mom and dad would understand... and I hope they'd be proud.
fatherReward_outcome1_outcome1_effect= Gained the Police Officer perk
fatherReward_outcome1_outcome2= I wanted to live above the law, to control the city from the shadows. I'd have diamonds in my teeth and anybody who messed with me would wake up with a horse's severed head in their bed.\n\n
When my fantasies got too specific, my mom sat me down and explained that real gangsters start at the bottom, and nearly all of them die or go to jail instead of getting rich and powerful. Eventually I forgot about it.\n\n
But... what the heck. I can be a gangster now if I want to. _Say hello to my little friend!_
fatherReward_outcome1_outcome2_effect= Gained the Gangster perk
fatherReward_outcome1_outcome3= I had a drum kit and played in a high school band, but we weren't very good and honestly I didn't practice very much. One day we moved to a smaller house and my parents made me leave the drums behind... after that I just kind of forgot about music.\n\n
But... what the hell, it's never too late. I'm going to learn to play for real and become the rockstar I never was. I'm going to call our band _Watermelon Iconoclast_. It has a good ring to it.
fatherReward_outcome1_outcome3_effect= Gained the Rockstar perk
fatherReward_outcome1_outcome4= They were always pressuring me to be somebody special, but I just wanted to stay a kid and have fun.\n\n
I guess they were trying to prepare me for the competitive adult world. They just wanted me to be happy when I grew up and to know who I was and how I fit into the world.\n\n
Well, mom, dad, I think I know who I am now. And though I might not be as happy as you'd hoped, I am proud of who I've become. I hope you would be too.

# Gangs of Deadsville - riffs & last judgment
#
# Help the Granville Riffs get revenge on Last Judgment for killing their leader, or side with Last Judgment
#
# Overview:
# Gang war level. Until conflict is resolved there is a low chance of a negative event occurring every turn that involves one of your survivors getting injured the crossfire
# Whichever gang you agree to help, they want you to capture a (the only?) Mall on the map to use as an arena.
# Mall should be reasonably close to your base, but still require a little work to make it out to it.
# Epic fight occurs, you have option of back stabbing your allies after you've learned more about them.
# Zed interrupt the fight, lose the square, but whichever side you sided with got badly eaten. (They have limited defenses for the rest of the level?)
# Chase enemies back to base have a showdown with their boss. (Could either be a set event, or you might need to attack and take the main square of their base if that functionality exists.
# Enemy boss is defeated, but makes a narrow escape (So they can still show up later in the game.)
# For the rest of the level no more crossfire events occur and your allies help you kill Zed. (Either by random events, or bonus to combat, or whatever mechanics make the most sense.)
# Option to say no to helping out both gangs exists. Can no longer complete questline, crossfire event chance increases.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Start by meeting with both Gangs. 1a + 1b can happen in any order, but both must occur before moving on to 2.
# 1a. Meet Riffs
gangsRiffsStart_title= Meet the Neighbors
gangsRiffsStart_picture= [FactionBackground]
gangsRiffsStart_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
gangsRiffsStart= I've never seen so many chiseled bodies as when I walked through the Granville Riffs heavily fortified compound the first time. It seemed like everyone from the biggest bruiser to the littlest old lady had a six-pack from all that martial arts training they do.\n\n
Had a chance to meet with their lanky boss, Malik, while I was there. Told me that he'd be watching us. Keeping the Zed in-check was their first concern, but they wouldn't tolerate us causing any trouble like those damn bikers from the Last Judgment on the other side of town.
gangsRiffsStart_option1= Tell Malik not to worry
gangsRiffsStart_option2= Tell Malik to drop the act
gangsRiffsStart_outcome1= Malik gave me a grim smile, and told me to let him know if we ever need help bringing down a few Zed, they could arrange to send a few guys over.
gangsRiffsStart_outcome2= Malik just stared at me through those mirrored sunglasses without saying a word. After a couple of minutes I started to feel a little awkward and let myself out.


# 1b. Meet Judgment
gangsJudgmentStart_title= Meet the Neighbors
gangsJudgmentStart_picture= [FactionBackground]
gangsJudgmentStart_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
gangsJudgmentStart= The building at the center of the Last Judgment's base looked to be an old church, except the big neon sign above the door that read "The Sacrament" didn't quite fit. Surround by motor bikes, it looked more like a bar than a house of worship. Smelt like one too.\n\n
Inside a big fella wearing leather and half a dozen different gaudy crucifixes around his neck introduced himself as Father O'Grady. Offered me a beer and said he was looking forward to getting to know me. Hoped that I'd turn out to have bigger balls than those sneaky pajama wearers from the Riffs.
gangsJudgmentStart_option1= Let O'Grady know you won't let him down
gangsJudgmentStart_option2= Tell him your balls are bigger than his
gangsJudgmentStart_outcome1= O'Grady slapped me on the back with a meaty hand, gave me an ugly grin and told me that he would hold me to that.
gangsJudgmentStart_outcome2= O'Grady barked a short laugh which quickly turned into a sneer. Left me the beer and told me he'd be seeing me later.


# 2. Riffs ask for help to take out Judgment. Can respond by:
# - Going all in (gain Riffs rep). Go to 6
# - Saying you want to think about it. If visit with Judgment go to 4, else if visit Riffs again go to 3.
# - Tell them to get lost. (loose Riffs rep). Go to 3 when visit with Judgment. Can no longer advance with Riffs.

gangsRiffsHelp= Was grabbed by Malik during my visit to the Riffs today. Told me that the Last Judgment gang was making it hard to keep the dead in the ground. Every one of the Riff's cleanup squads in the last week had been hit by the bikers as they went after the Zed.\n\n
Said he had a plan on how to stop the Judgment from attacking everyone, but they needed some help to get things in place.
gangsRiffsHelp_option1= Agree to help
gangsRiffsHelp_option2= Say you need to think about it
gangsRiffsHelp_option3= Refuse to help
gangsRiffsHelp_outcome1= Malik did a sort of bow thing, which I tried to do back without much success. He said that I honored him and asked if I would follow....
gangsRiffsHelp_outcome2= Malik nodded and said that he understood, but hoped I'd decide soon. Each person he lost to an attack was likely going to end up another Zed shuffling through the city streets.
gangsRiffsHelp_outcome3= Told Malik he'd have to find someone else. He just gave me that blank stare that he does. Did my best try and stare him back down, but it only works so well when all you can see is yourself reflected in those mirrored shades.
gangsRiffsHelp_outcome1_option1= Follow him...


# 3. Riffs ask if you've come to your senses. Similar options as 2.
# - Going all in (gain Riffs rep). Go to 6

gangsRiffsHelp2_option2= Say you still need to think about it
gangsRiffsHelp2_option3= Refuse to help
gangsRiffsHelp2_outcome1= Malik did a sort of bow thing, which I tried to do back, without much success. Said that I honored him and asked if I would follow....
gangsRiffsHelp2_outcome1_option1= Follow him...
gangsRiffsHelp2_outcome2= Malik just shook his head and sighed.
gangsRiffsHelp2_outcome3= Told Malik he'd have to find someone else. He just gave me that blank stare that he does. Did my best try and stare him back down, but it only works so well when all you can see is yourself reflected in those mirrored shades.


# 4. Tell Judgment about Riffs. Learn that this isn't the first time Riffs have attacked. Judgment demands help. Need answer now. Can:
# - Agree to help out Judgment (gain Judgment rep). Go to 7.
# - Tell them to get lost. (loose Judgment rep). Can no longer advance with Judgment. If no longer advance with both, display 5 on the following day.
gangsJudgmentHelp_title= Allies Needed, Inquire Within
gangsJudgmentHelp_picture= [FactionBackground]
gangsJudgmentHelp_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
gangsJudgmentHelp= Was in the last Judgment church when Father O'Grady called me over to the pulpit from which he hands down his orders. I ended up letting it slip that the Riffs had been asking for my help .\n\n
He just chuckled at that and said that this wasn't the first time. The Granville Riffs were grabbing up all the best caches of supplies from round town and his fellas were starting to have to eat their boots to avoid going hungry.\n\n
He had a plan that would allow him to get rid of the Riffs once and for all, and told me he'd make it worth my while if I'd lend a hand.
gangsJudgmentHelp_option1= Agree to help
gangsJudgmentHelp_option2= Refuse to help
gangsJudgmentHelp_outcome1= O'Grady slammed close the book in front of him. He told me I'd made the right choice as he ushered me into the rectory.
gangsJudgmentHelp_outcome1_option1= Follow him...
gangsJudgmentHelp_outcome2= Told O'Grady that he'd have to find some other chump. He scowled at me and said I'd regret my actions sooner rather than later.


# 5. Everyone is pissed off. Some time later warn the player that crossfire event chance has increased.
gangsRefusal_title= On Your Own
gangsRefusal_picture= street
gangsRefusal= Ever since I refused to help either side of Riffs/Judgment gang war, things look like they've just been getting worse between the two groups. It's going to be ever harder to avoid getting caught by a stray bullet or throwing star with us sitting right in the middle.


# 6. Helping Riffs. They tell you that they need a proper arena to have it out, and suggest a local mall that they used to hang out at. You need to clear that area of Zed and add it to your Fort. Go to 8 when first entering square.
gangsRiffsPlan_title= War Games
gangsRiffsPlan_picture= [FactionBackground]
gangsRiffsPlan_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
gangsRiffsPlan= Malik led me into the back office of his dojo which was lined wall-to-wall with all sorts of exotic edged weapons and I got the impression he knew how to use every one of them. He pulled out a map of the area and pointed out the old Crossroads Mall that the Riffs used to spend their down time at.\n\n
If we cleared it of Zed and built a few walls to keep any more coming in, it wouldn't be to hard to lure the Last Judgment in with the promise of the goods that all the little boutiques still held. And between us and the Riffs, we'd be able to let the air out of the Judgment's tires permanently.


# 7. Helping Judgment. They tell you that they need a proper arena to have it out, and suggest a local mall that they used to hang out at. You need to clear that area of Zed and add it to your Fort. Go to 8 when first entering square.

gangsJudgmentPlan_picture= [FactionBackground]
gangsJudgmentPlan_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
gangsJudgmentPlan= O'Grady's place was surprisingly clean, though that probably had more to do with the resigned looking woman in the French maid's outfit and the duster rather than any work on O'Grady's part.\n\n
He opened up a map of the local area and showed me the location of the Crossroads Mall that he said the Riffs used to consider their own. If we were to clean the Zed out and occupy it ourselves, the Riffs would be honor-bound to try and take it back, and then we'd have them.

# 8. Description of mall. Go to 9 when square added to fort.
gangsMall_title= Hallowed Halls
gangsMall_picture= parking
gangsMall= The Crossroads Mall has seen better days. Squirrels climbing out of mannequins, birds nesting in the rafters, broken glass and withered plants everywhere. Still, hygiene standards hadn't changed much in the food court, even counting the skeleton we found in one of the deep friers.\n\n
We spent hours piling junk in front of doors, boarding up windows, and sweeping the glass and zombie giblets out of the halls. The Crossroads Mall is ready for the showdown.\n\n
We should let {1} know everything's ready.

# 10. Riffs thank you, and let slip about their master trying to take over the Judgment before to get their stuff. Fight occurs in two days, go to 12.
gangsRiffsReady_title= The One That Started It All
gangsRiffsReady_picture= [FactionBackground]
gangsRiffsReady_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
gangsRiffsReady= Malik bowed and brought down a nasty looking sword from the portrait of an older man. He explained the man had been head of the Riffs before Father O'Grady cut his life short. True, it hadn't been wise of his master to take on Last Judgment alone, but they'd insulted him by refusing to submit to the Riff's protection. So... this whole mess got started when the old master's power play went sour.\n\n
Malik fingered the blade's edge and stared at the picture, then told me things were already in motion. Both gangs will meet at the mall tomorrow and sort this feud out once and for all.

# 11. Judgment say you're one bad $#^!, and tell you about how they graphically tortured the Riff's leader before killing him. Fight occurs in two days, go to 12.
gangsJudgmentReady_title= The One That Started It All
gangsJudgmentReady_picture= [FactionBackground]
gangsJudgmentReady_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
gangsJudgmentReady= Father O'Grady jumped up to his pulpit and started rallying people around him.\n\n
"The Riffs don't know it," he shouted, "but they're living their last hours. Soon they'll all be strung up and gutted for their sins, just like their old master when he came calling 'round. [CityName] will know the price of messing with the Last Judgment!"\n\n
After the cheering died down he looked over and said he let the word out to the Riffs. Their honor required them to show up at the mall tomorrow where this feud would end once and for all.

# 12. Dramatic fight setup occurs. You have the option of choosing who you want to help at this point:
# - Help the Riffs, go to 13b if you were already helping them, or 13a if you are betraying them.
# - Help the Judgment, go to 14b if you were already helping them, or 14a if you are betraying them.
gangsChoice_title= Choosing Sides
gangsChoice_picture= parking
gangsChoice= On the day of the fight a few of our guys set up on the roof of the mall. We spotted the Granville Riffs wearing plain black uniforms and armed to the teeth with bladed weapons making their way to one of the side doors. At the same time, it was hard to miss the roar of the Last Judgment's engines as they pulled up to the main entrance, loaded for bear.\n\n
From our position looking down the sky lights onto the two gangs making their way through the dilapidated structure, both sides looked fairly equal in number. It wouldn't take more than a few shots from our guys to change that pretty fast.
gangsChoice_option1= Attack the Granville Riffs
gangsChoice_option2= Attack the Last Judgment

# 13a. Riffs decry your betrayal while Judgment cheers, go to 13b. (Loose rep with Riffs)
gangsChoiceBetrayal_outcome1= Our guys opened up on the Riffs with the few bullets we had. From below Malik gave me a look that burned it's way straight through his shades and into my brain. I'm guessing I'm not long for this world if he ever gets his hands on me.
gangsChoiceBetrayal_outcome1_option1= Continue...
# 13b. Describe battle aggrandizing the Judgment while villainizing the Riffs. Go to 15.
gangsChoice_outcome1= The Last Judgment threw together a barricade from kiosks and tacky furniture. They laid into the Riffs with automatic weapons while we took pot shots from above. The Riffs darted from pillar to pillar and bore down on the Last Judgment. Their knives and shuriken sailed through cracks in the barricade with disturbing accuracy.\n\n
Father O'Grady shouted encouragement to his congregation. With rosary beads wrapped around his fists, he held his own with the martial artists slipping past the barricade. He cracked skulls and broke bones of any who dared come within reach.
gangsChoice_outcome1_option1= Continue...

# 14a. Judgment decry your betrayal while Riffs cheers, go to 13b. (Loose rep with Judgment)
gangsChoiceBetrayal_outcome2= Father O'Grady was swearing to high heaven when we turned our guns on the Last Judgment. I'll probably be the next one he tries to gut if he gets the chance.
gangsChoiceBetrayal_outcome2_option1= Continue...
# 14b. Describe battle aggrandizing the Riffs while villainizing the Judgment. Go to 15.
gangsChoice_outcome2= Even running straight into the lines of Judgment gang members, the Riffs showed no fear, and with a blur of motion and the song of steel as the blades passed through the air into flesh and bone, O'Grady's men began to fall.\n\n
All that fighting with the Zed must have taught Malik a thing or two about going for the neck, as he moved like a black guillotine through the Last Judgment's ranks, leaving a trail of headless corpses in his wake.
gangsChoice_outcome2_option1= Continue...

# 15. Zed break into the Mall and start attacking everyone. Do you:
# - Flee, leaving your allies in the lurch? Both sides get badly hurt, crossfire event ends as the gangs lick their wounds, neither side is that happy but they are too hurt to fight one another. (Both sides are weak for rest of level.)
# - Help your allies escape? You lose the Mall square (Zed reclaim + have major presence in afterwards), but the enemies are badly hurt. (Enemies are weak for rest of level). Allies say you should finish the enemies off. Go to 16 if you are helping the Riffs during the fight and you go to the Judgment base, or 17 if you are helping the Judgment during the fight and go to the Riffs base.
gangsInterruption_title= A Rude Interruption
gangsInterruption_picture= parking
gangsInterruption= Just as things were coming to a head, there was a crash as the front doors of the Crossroads Mall caved inward and the Zed, probably lured by the noise and smell of blood, came barreling through and fell upon both sides.\n\n
We could either run for our lives and clean up the mall once everyone had finished eating one another, or use what little ammunition we had left to clear our allies a path out of there. We'd probably lose the mall, but they would stand a better chance of surviving the night.
gangsInterruption_option1= Let them kill one another
gangsInterruption_option2= Clear a path
gangsInterruption_outcome1= It didn't take long before the two gangs realized their only chance was to team up to fight the horde. But even with the Riffs' steel and the Judgment's firepower, it was a rough fight.\n\n
As the last zed finally fell, O'Grady and Malik looked over what was left of their forces and seemed to decide there'd been enough killing for today. They silently gathered their remaining people together and headed their separate ways.\n\n
Neither is very happy with us, but hopefully their bloodlust is sated now.
gangsInterruption_outcome2= I sprinted down the fire escape as my guys fired at the approaching horde. Hitting the ground at full tilt, I grabbed a crowbar and wrenched the boards off a window near where the two gangs had been butting heads. In seconds there were {1} pouring out the new exit and we ran like the hounds of hell were on our heels.\n\n
We could barely breathe by the time we made it to safety and our hearts were beating so fast, but I think most of us made it out of there alive. Not so sure about {2}. We better head over to their base now and finish them off.

# 16. Description of final fight with Father O'Grady and his eventual escape. Judgment is wiped off the map. Get gift + big rep with Riffs, loose big rep with Judgment. Crossfire event ends, while Riffs help you fight Zed for rest of level.
gangsJudgmentEnd_title= Last of the Judgment
gangsJudgmentEnd_picture= [FactionBackground]
gangsJudgmentEnd= We stormed the Last Judgment base with help from the Granville Riffs. The Judgment were still hurting from the mall and didn't put up much of a fight, but as we neared the church there was a screech of tires and roar of an engine. Father O'Grady crashed out of the main doors on his massive white hog. Screaming obscenities, he blasted past us and away into the empty streets of [CityName].\n\n
Malik thanked us for all our help and offered me the sword that had belonged to his master. He is honored to be our ally.

# 17. Description of final fight with Malik and his eventual escape. Riffs are wiped off the map. Get gift + big rep with Judgment, loose big rep with Riffs. Crossfire event ends, while Judgment help you fight Zed for rest of level.
gangsRiffsEnd_title= End of the Riffs
gangsRiffsEnd_picture= [FactionBackground]
gangsRiffsEnd= O'Grady and the Last Judgment were already looting the Riff's dojo by the time we got there. They'd rushed in only to find it empty.\n\n
Well, mostly empty. The first four guys to enter were discovered with their heads missing. They were lying in front of a blank wall which had once held the painting of the old master.\n\n
Nevertheless, Father O'Grady was in good spirits and even gave me one of his bikes as thanks. It's huge, white and covered with crosses... a bit gaudy for my tastes, but it'll get me around.

# award a perk at the end of this plotline no matter how it turned out
gangsReward_title= On Leadership
gangsReward_picture= cityHall
gangsReward_pictureColin= true
gangsReward= The violence between the Riffs and Last Judgment has made me realize the value of having strong leadership that all sides will follow.\n\n
Back before the outbreak, I was...
# all lead to the same next option
gangsReward_option1= a staunch liberal
gangsReward_option2= proudly conservative
gangsReward_option3= Libertarian
gangsReward_option4= not very interested in politics
gangsReward_outcome1= But how can anything ever get done if we squabble over who gets to be in charge, and constantly undermine any decision the other side makes? There's no time for Red Team vs Blue Team politics these days.\n\n
Today's leaders have to make decisions under pressure, and know that our people will respect them. I've decided to start taking my job as leader more seriously.\n\n
I'm going to be...
gangsReward_outcome1_option1= a Politician
gangsReward_outcome1_option2= a Priest
gangsReward_outcome1_option3= a Pizza Delivery Driver
gangsReward_outcome1_option4= just a good person
gangsReward_outcome1_outcome1= A leader's most important job is to be loved. Or feared. At any rate, respected by the people they lead and by other groups they interact with.\n\n
A good politician knows that job security is key. So long as the people are on your side, you can screw up all you want.
gangsReward_outcome1_outcome1_effect= Gained the Politician perk
gangsReward_outcome1_outcome2= Religion is the opiate of the people. It's pretty cynical, but yeah... we haven't found a better way to control people in all the years of human history.\n\n
It provides an answer to everything, from "why are we at war?" to "why do you get more to eat than me?". God is the ultimate leader. Whoever gets to speak for Him has a hell of a lot of power.\n\n
Good thing _I'm_ going to use it to help people!
gangsReward_outcome1_outcome2_effect= Gained the Priest perk
gangsReward_outcome1_outcome3= Just kidding. Well not about being a pizza delivery driver; I'm serious about that. But I know it isn't going to make anyone look up to me or make me a better leader or anything.\n\n
I just think that good leaders come from all walks of life. It's not something you can really be trained to do... you just have to be that person.\n\n
So I'm going to be that person, and also drive a sweet car and maybe chop the heads off of zombies as I cruise by them.
gangsReward_outcome1_outcome3_effect= Gained the Pizza Delivery Driver perk
gangsReward_outcome1_outcome4= Being a good leader isn't about what skills you have, it's about being selfless and able to consider the needs and wants of a whole bunch of people. It's about empathy.

# Return to New York - riffs
#
# Convince the Granville Riffs to return to their home city of New York
#
# Overview:
# Gangs of Deadsville needs to be completed prior?
# Riffs have been getting strong in this city. While they are keeping the Zed down in their area they are also claiming most of the resources in the area and no one is strong enough to stand up to them
# You get a message that things haven't been going well for their friends back home
# They want to leave, but don't want to leave the people unprotected and will only do so if they can bring everyone with them.
# Need kill zombies to prove strength, transport (boat?), fuel, river charts and captain who knows how pilot a larger ship
# Boat - Need to claim marine square
# Fuel - One of the other groups may have stockpile. Government or Pharmacists? Need to negotiate or claim from them
# Captain - Need to recruit person from specific square. Could be found by random searches, or after a certain number of days Gustav may show up and tell
# River Charts - Need to scavenge from a specific square. Could be found by random searches, or the captain may know.
# Get Riffs territory + a couple of people upon completion?
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Visit Riffs base. Describe Riffs sprawling headquarters. Mention monopoly of supplies
newyorkVisit_title= The Granville Riffs
newyorkVisit_picture= [FactionBackground]
newyorkVisit_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
newyorkVisit= I peeked in one of the Riffs' hangar-sized warehouses today - it was packed to the brim! They've got everything from MREs to zip-ties. I asked Malik how they did it and waited while he studied me quietly.\n\n
"No big deal for the baddest martial-artists this side of the world," he said. "We've been honing our qi for years, way before the infection. We're the best, so we get first pick of the goods."\n\n
It'll take diplomacy if we want some of their supplies. I'm not keen to fight a hundred sets of rippling muscles and fists of steel for it.


# 2. Event occurs day or two later: Riffs messenger found by scouts. Describes group back in New York. Says they're in trouble.
newyorkMessenger_title= The New Yorker
newyorkMessenger_picture= gateStranger
newyorkMessenger_pictureColin= false
newyorkMessenger= [Name] spotted a survivor in a Granville Riffs' karate outfit limping his way through the city. He had no meat on his bones and was delirious by the time [Name] brought him in.\n\n
Once he'd had a rest and some hearty pigeon stew, we learned he's not from [CityName] at all. He introduced himself as Jamal, from the original Granville Riffs dojo from New York. He'd come west with a message for Malik from his "sensei".\n\n
We pointed Jamal to the Riffs fort. He bowed deeply and said we should ask for a reward the next time we visit them.

# 3. Visit Riffs base. Get backstory from Malik. Says he would like to head back, but they need sufficient fuel and parts for their caravan. Points out 5 gas stations (each one named a take off of a gang from the warriors) on the map where the parts may be found. Secretly each one of these is a test of ability (offense, scavenging, science, building, leadership.) Don't need the ability, but makes it a lot easier if person scavenging/scouting location has it. Can repeat test if failed. 4-8 all become available and must be completed before moving to 9. Note: run _end regardless of which outcome is selected.
newyorkBackstory_title= News from New York
newyorkBackstory_picture= [FactionBackground]
newyorkBackstory_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
newyorkBackstory= It's hard to read Malik's stony expression, but I think I saw hints of surprise and pride that his dojo-brother Jamal had made the long journey from New York through such hostile territory.\n\n
Unfortunately, the news he brought wasn't good. In the years since Malik and the others left, the remaining New York Riffs had been struggling to survive. Their sensei Cypress was ageing, and there was fierce competition and even fiercer undead in the big city. They'd been forced underground to the subway tunnels, a home unbefitting such a proud and once-strong clan.
newyorkBackstory_option1= Offer your condolences
newyorkBackstory_option2= Be indifferent
# +5 respect for condolences
newyorkBackstory_outcome1= Malik just grunted at he stared into the distance through his mirrored shades, which he still wore despite the dim lighting in their sparring hall.\n\n
I guess they help him to hide his emotions, either because he thinks he's too tough to feel things, or because he doesn't want the rest of his people to see how worried he really is.
newyorkBackstory_outcome1_option1= Ask about a reward
newyorkBackstory_outcome1_option2= Leave
newyorkBackstory_outcome2= I told Malik that it sucked to be them and shrugged. He just stared at me impassively and motioned to the guards to hold their positions. Given their expressions, I'm pretty sure they'd have broken at least a few of my ribs if he hadn't.
newyorkBackstory_outcome2_option1= Ask about a reward
newyorkBackstory_outcome2_option2= Leave
# +ammo if you ask about reward
newyorkBackstory_reward= Malik nodded to an enormous man who dropped a large ammo box in my arms. It was so heavy I could barely hold it. As I strained under the weight, Malik became suddenly talkative.\n\n
He explained that he and the other Riffs had been planning a trip to New York for some time, and this meant they had to leave soon. But it was a big trip. They had a caravan of trucks and mobile homes and plenty of supplies, but there was still much to do. They could use our help, he said.
newyorkBackstory_reward_option1= Agree to help
newyorkBackstory_reward_option2= Ask what's in it for us
newyorkBackstory_leave= As I stood up to go, Malik became suddenly talkative.\n\n
He explained that he and the other Riffs had been planning to pack up and go back to New York for some time, and this meant they had to leave soon. But it was a big trip. They had a caravan of trucks and mobile homes and plenty of supplies, but there was still much to do. They could use our help, he said.
newyorkBackstory_leave_option1= Agree to help
newyorkBackstory_leave_option2= Ask what's in it for us
# regardless of whether you agree to don't
newyorkBackstory_end= Malik either didn't hear me or didn't care. He continued.\n\n
They needed fuel for the trip - a lot of it. He pointed out three gas stations that might still have it. They also needed auto parts, spare tires and tools. Malik wrote down the names of two auto workshops in [CityName].\n\n
So we have 5 places to search. It's a lot of work, but Malik says the Riffs will repay us big-time if we do it all.

# quest mission to Collect Gas (uh, dangerous?) on an (or all?) unfortified gas station full of zombies
# 4. Test of Offense. Fuel. Station is swarming with zed. Can charge in blazing (4a), try and lure them out (4b), or snipe gas truck sitting nearby (4c). Otherwise can leave (4d). "TB Gas"
# 4a. Full success
# 4b. Kills all zombies on square, but most of fuel is lost. Partial success.
# 4c. Roll total offense level / 30
# 4d. Leave area.
newyorkOffence_title= Test of Might
newyorkOffence_picture= parking
newyorkOffence_pictureColin= false
newyorkOffence= Zombies. Every angle I looked at the gas station, all I could see was zombies. Picking their way past the two tanker trucks, crawling out of the ice cooler, sucking on the pipes... the station was covered in them.\n\n
I really needed some way to get rid of the horde so I could load up one of the tankers and get that fuel back to the Riffs. As I saw it, I could try to lure them away, distract them by shooting one of the gas tankers, or just shoot zombies until the're all dead. Well, dead-er.
newyorkOffence_option1= Lure the Zed away (uses Zombie Bait)
newyorkOffence_option2= Blow up a tanker truck
newyorkOffence_option3= Run in, guns blazing (defense skill)
newyorkOffence_option4= Try again later
# uses one Zombie Bait and flag as full success
newyorkOffence_outcome1= [We] set up one of our zombie lures in a nearby bus depot and those zed came running. It was actually so potent it started pulling in zed from other neighborhoods, and [we] almost ran into another group when trying to circle round the first.\n\n
With a bit luck (and a few mad sprints) [we] made it back to the gas station. [We] consolidated all of the fuel in one tanker and drove it carefully away from bus depot, which looked like it was hosting some sort of zombie rave by then.
newyorkOffence_outcome1_effect= Found fuel for the Riffs
# kill all zombies and flag as partial success
newyorkOffence_outcome2= And they say movie explosions aren't realistic. I tell you, [we] put a single bullet into the tank of that fuel truck and the whole place went sky-high. You must have been able to see it from a mile away.\n\n
It sure cleared out all the undead in the area (along with a few eyebrows), but unfortunately it burned away a lot of the fuel we were here to collect. We still managed to siphon what was left in the underground tanks though.
newyorkOffence_outcome2_effect= Found some fuel for the Riffs
# full success
newyorkOffence_outcome3_success= All that time out in the field killing zed sure paid off. [We] set up a barricade in the doorway of a nearby hotel and let the undead come to us.\n\n
One by one they fell, heads opened, brains covering the concrete. Not one made it past [our] kill zone. Once all the zed were dead or incapacitated, [we] took [our] time and collected all of the fuel in one tanker. As [we] drove it out of there, [we] crushed the last few zombie skulls under [our] tires.
newyorkOffence_outcome3_success_effect= Found fuel for the Riffs
# failure, need to repeat mission, [Name] is injured
newyorkOffence_outcome3_fail= [Name] did [his] best, but there were just too many of them. Before long [he] was running for [his] life through the desolate city streets. None of the zed managed to get their teeth in [him], but he tore something while climbing over a barbed wire fence.\n\n
[He]'ll probably need a few days recovery before [he]'s up and about, and a heck of a lot more training before [he] tries that again. Before the day was out those zed were back in that gas station though.
Maybe if we could build some sort of zombie lure, it might be easier to lead them away than face them directly.
# failure, need to repeat mission
newyorkOffence_outcome4= I looked at the weather and decided that today wasn't a good day to try anything quite this stupid.\n\n
Maybe wait for a nicer day. Or a worse day. Or just any other day, for that matter.\n\n
Next time we should send someone who knows a thing or two about fighting to clear these Zed out.

# 5. Test of Scavenging. Part. The building is covered in garbage and construction equipment. Can dig through (5a), try to jury-rig magnetic crane to lift out engine part (5b), use bulldozer to move all the pieces (5c). Otherwise can leave (5d). "Waif Automotive Parts"
# 5a. Full success if scavenging > 7, fail otherwise, zed hear and person is injured.
# 5b. Full success if car batteries tech researched, otherwise fail.
# 5c. Moves all rubble, but some of the parts are damaged in the process. Partial success.
# 5d. Leave area.
newyorkScavenge_title= Test of Perception
newyorkScavenge_picture= workshop
newyorkScavenge_pictureColin= false
newyorkScavenge= [We] had some trouble finding the car repair shop the Riffs had sent us to at first. Turns out it had been undergoing renovations when everything went down, and [we] hadn't realized that the pile broken roof panels, scaffolding and construction equipment [we]'d passed three times was the actual shop.\n\n
My instincts told me [we] could probably find usable parts somewhere in this mess, but I'm not sure how to get to them. [We] could pick through rubble by hands, but that might take awhile unless [we're] quite good at scavenging. Or there's a bulldozer [we] could try to use but it might just make a bigger mess.
newyorkScavenge_option1= Dig through the wreckage (scavenging skill)
newyorkScavenge_option2= Use the bulldozer
newyorkScavenge_option3= Try again later
# mark as success
newyorkScavenge_outcome1_success= I guessed where the building's storage might be and set to work there. Using an old stop sign as both a shovel and lever to clear the heavier stuff, I dug through junk with surprising speed.\n\n
I was a bit startled when I noticed something inside the pile digging it's way up towards me, but the stop sign also proved to make a surprisingly good ax when the zombie poked it's head out of rubble.\n\n
Crawling past the now headless corpse, [we] scrambled through the tight passage and into the building where [we] found that the tables of the store room was still packed with parts and tools. Success! Hopefully this is what the Riffs need.
newyorkScavenge_outcome1_success_effect= Found tools and car parts for the Riffs
# three massed zombies spawn beside the fort, can re-attempt mission later
newyorkScavenge_outcome1_fail= I dug through the junk pile for hours with no luck. I was so tired by the time night fell, I didn't notice something was wrong until a cold and inhumanly strong hand grabbed my shoulder.\n\n
They almost had [us] surrounded. There's nothing quite like adrenaline to get you up and going, and no better cardio routine than running from the undead. [We] made it back to the gates with them still on [our] tail. Unfortunately now they've massed up against our walls and are very excited about getting through them. Oops.
newyorkScavenge_outcome1_fail_effect= Massed zombies spawned
# partial success, building turns to rubble
newyorkScavenge_outcome2= Someone had left the keys in the bulldozer's ignition and the machine still had plenty of juice.\n\n
Revving the giant beast up, I plowed straight through the junk surrounding the site and into the building, promptly knocking over a load bearing wall and causing half the building to collapse in on itself.\n\n
Looking through what was left of the wreckage, [we] did manage to find a few usable tools, but it looked like most of the stuff we came for was in the section of the building that collapsed.
newyorkScavenge_outcome2_effect= Found some tools for the Riffs
# can try again later
newyorkScavenge_outcome3= [We] poked the pile with a stick a couple of times, but decided that this was more work than [we] [were] getting paid for.\n\n
We should probably send someone who knows a thing or two about scavenging to give that place another once over.

# parking lot
# 6. Test of Science. Fuel. The gas here has been contaminated by anarchists. Need to figure out which works. Can run some experiments on it (6a), try and work out what the anarchists did (6b), or just take everything we can carry (6c). Otherwise can leave (6d). Near softball stadium. "Erinyes Co."
# 6a. Full success if science > 7, fail otherwise, (sets fire to self) injury.
# 6b. Half the stuff brought back is bad. Partial success.
# 6c. Leave area.
newyorkScience_title= Test of Intellect
newyorkScience_picture= parking
newyorkScience_pictureColin= false
newyorkScience= The cars in this parking lot have been badly vandalized - headlights smashed, roofs caved-in, anarchy symbols spray-painted on the doors. Evidence of looters and vandals went nuts in the early days of the infection when it seemed the lack of law enforcement was only temporary.\n\n
Many of the gas caps are off and there's sugar and 2 liter pop bottles about. There's still gas to siphon, but it's hard to tell what's tainted and how badly. [We] could try to engineer a solution, or just take it all and hope it still works.
newyorkScience_option1= Use science (engineering skill)
newyorkScience_option2= Just grab everything
newyorkScience_option3= Try again later
# success
newyorkScience_outcome1_success= It turns out that sugar doesn't dissolve in gasoline, so that whole thing about it caramelizing inside the engine and destroying it was just an urban legend. We simply siphoned off gas out of all the cars into large canisters, waited for the sugar to settle to the bottom, then siphoned again to remove it.
newyorkScience_outcome1_success_effect= Found fuel for the Riffs
# fail, can try again later
newyorkScience_outcome1_fail= [Name] came up with a few different ideas for how to get the sugar out or how to test if the gasoline would still work. After some inconclusive theorizing, [he] decided to test the gas by to lighting samples of it on fire.\n\n
On the bright side, our medics now have more experience treating second degree burns. But [Name] will be out of commission for a few days. We should probably send someone back there who knows a bit more about science in general. Or at least about proper safety procedures.
# partial success
newyorkScience_outcome2= [We] siphoned all the gasoline [we] could from all the cars and mixed it all together. Likely it's all contaminated now, and might destroy any engine you put it into after a few hours. Or maybe not, I mean, how could you know until you try?
newyorkScience_outcome2_effect= Found some fuel for the Riffs... maybe
# try again later
newyorkScience_outcome3= Next time we should send someone who knows a bit more about chemicals or science.

# 7. Test of Building. Part. The part they need is in the basement, but the stairs have fallen in and the elevator is out of order. Can dig up stairs (7a), try and get elevator working (7b), or use nearby sledge hammer to break through floor (7c). Otherwise can leave (7d). "Beth's Foreign Cars"
# 7a. Full success if building > 7, fail otherwise, (structure collapses in on self halfway through) injury.
# 7b. Full success if generator researched, fail otherwise.
# 7c. Find weak point and break through, but a bunch of the parts need is crushed by the rubble. Partial success.
# 7d. Leave area.
newyorkBuild_title= Test of Craftsmanship
newyorkBuild_picture= workshop
newyorkBuild_pictureColin= false
newyorkBuild= The main floor of Beth's Auto Repair had been cleaned out long before [we] made it there. The shelves were bare and the only cars left were total lemons. Above it was what looked like a hardware store, but the wooden stairs leading up to it were rickety as hell, and the platform between the stairs and the door was completely rotted through and wouldn't hold weight. [We]'d have to jump it.\n\n
There's also an elevator, but we'd need to power it.
newyorkBuild_option1= Try to fix the stairs (building skill)
newyorkBuild_option2= Jump it
newyorkBuild_option3= Use the elevator (electricity)
newyorkBuild_option4= Try again later
# full success
newyorkBuild_outcome1_success= A few extra joists on the staircase made it sturdy enough to climb, and the hood from one of the lemons worked as a temporary landing. It took [us] half an hour but [we] worked quiet enough to avoid attracting any zed.\n\n
Upstairs, [we] found [ourselves] looking at a treasure trove of old and exotic car parts, and premium fluids needed for all sorts of collector's models. It took some time to go through the cataloging system that switched between English, German and Japanese, but I think [we] found some stuff the Riffs can use.
newyorkBuild_outcome1_success_effect= Found parts for the Riffs
# use up 5 materials and can try again later
newyorkBuild_outcome1_fail= It would be charitable to call the stairs unstable. Treacherous would probably be more appropriate. [We] couldn't find any decent materials to rebuild them and made several trips back to the fort for supplies. When it seemed done, I took the first trip up them, and had to leap free when the entire structure collapsed under me.\n\n
This whole thing was a massive waste of time. If we try again, we should send somebody who knows a bit more about construction next time.
# partial success
newyorkBuild_outcome2= I felt like a tightrope walker edging my way up the shaky wooden stairs and across the gap. I made the jump pretty easily and felt good about myself, then looked back and realized [we]'d have to do it again while holding whatever [we] found inside.\n\n
There were plenty of car parts and tools in the store, but I only grabbed the lightest stuff, reasoning that my life wasn't worth risking for the rest.
newyorkBuild_outcome2_effect= Found some parts for the Riffs
# success
newyorkBuild_outcome3= The elevator hadn't been serviced in years, but it was a workhorse of a little machine and [we] got it up and running fast. The elevator door opened to reveal a desiccated corpse splayed on the floor with an assault rifle in one hand. While it looked like it hadn't moved in years, I still smashed the thing's head off to be sure.\n\n
Riding the elevator up, [we] discovered a small horde of old vehicle parts. One filled trolley and jittery ride back down the elevator later, and [we] wheeled a cart load of parts home with a smile.
newyorkBuild_outcome3_effect= Found parts for the Riffs
# come back later
newyorkBuild_outcome4= Next time we should probably send someone with some construction skill who could build us a way up there.

# 8. Test of Leadership. Fuel. Need to deal with an irate group of Last Judgment gang members getting the fuel for their bikes. Can try convince them you know of some better stuff elsewhere (8a), try to convince them that the Riffs need it (8b), or wait until they're done and take what is left (8c). Otherwise leave (8d). "Hoodlum Gas and Go"
# 8a. Full success if leadership > 7, fail otherwise.
# 8b. Full success if diplomacy researched, fail otherwise. (Gets beaten up by Last Judgment) injury.
# 8c. There is some fuel left after their done siphoning, but not much. Partial success.
# 8d. Leave area.
newyorkLeadership_title= Test of Leadership
newyorkLeadership_picture= parking
newyorkLeadership_pictureColin= judgment
newyorkLeadership= As [we] approached the gas station, the air filled with the obnoxious sound of revving motorcycle engines. A group of bikers had beaten [us] to the pump.\n\n
They were members of the Last Judgment Gang, using the station as a refueling stop while they were passing through. They called out: "Look what we have here. A little stray kitty crawling out of the alley. What can we do for you little alley cat?"\n\n
Outnumbered, I tried to think of how I could convince them to give [us] the gas. An outright lie? The truth? Or just try and stall them and hope they lost interest?
newyorkLeadership_option1= Lie about a bigger supply elsewhere
# hide this option if they are not even on the map or are defeated or unmet
newyorkLeadership_option2= Tell them the truth (75 respect)
newyorkLeadership_option3= Stall for as long as you can
newyorkLeadership_option4= Get out of there
# success
newyorkLeadership_outcome1_success= I asked them why they were here in this crappy gas station when there was a full reservoir of Premium Super Gold Star Plus at the Exxor station across town.\n\n
The Judgment boys were skeptical at first, but I exhorted them to take advantage of oxygenation, better fuel efficiency and scrubbing bubbles that cleaned your engine while you drove, until they either believed me or got sick of me and left.\n\n
The instant they turned the corner, [we] filled every canister [we] could find and got out of there. Don't want to be around when they learn they'd been had.
newyorkLeadership_outcome1_success_effect= Found fuel for the Riffs
# fail, -5 respect if last judgment exist, can come back later
newyorkLeadership_outcome1_fail= [We] did [our] best to sound convincing, but the Last Judgment just weren't buying it. They're settled in there good, at least for now. We might try again, but should send someone better at negotiations and leadership.
# success
newyorkLeadership_outcome2_success= The bikers started to raise weapons at the mention of the Riffs, but [we] plowed forward, explaining that the Riffs were planning on leaving town once they had the gas, and that after they left, [CityName] would be a playground for anyone left...\n\n
The leader chuckled. "That's not a bad idea, little kitty. This city would be a lot more fun without those bastards showing up round every corner. You grab the gas you need."\n\n
Before they could change their minds [we] grabbed a couple full tanks and headed out. My heart didn't leave my throat until [we] [were] back inside our walls.
newyorkLeadership_outcome2_success_effect= Found fuel for the Riffs
# partial success
newyorkLeadership_outcome3= Throwing on all the charm I could, I began to run through an impromptu stand up routine, using such classics as: "What does a vegetarian zombie eat? Grains!" and "Why didn't the zombie cross the road? Because he'd lost his guts!".\n\n
And... it worked. Apparently [we]'d found the only bikers ever who liked bad puns. They kept chuckling until they'd finished filling up and drove off, saying "See ya later, funny cat!"
They'd taken a lot of the gasoline, but there was still a bit left which [we] siphoned off into a canister. I hope the Riffs appreciate everything we're doing for them.
newyorkLeadership_outcome3_effect= Found some fuel for the Riffs
# fail, come back later
newyorkLeadership_outcome4= [We] decided the best strategy was to turn and pretend the bikers didn't exist. Fortunately for [us], while they shouted a few more catcalls, the Last Judgment boys were too busy collecting the gas to bother with chasing a stranger down.\n\n
Next time we should send someone a little more diplomatic. If there is even any gas left by then.

# 9. Visit Riffs after completing 4-8. Malik thanks you for your help tells you about the test.
# use newyorkLeave_success if we had 0 or 1 partial successes, otherwise newyorkLeave_fail
# either way we get all their territory and they are destroyed
newyorkLeave_title= Return to New York
newyorkLeave_picture= [FactionBackground]
newyorkLeave_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
newyorkLeave= I thought I saw a faint smile on Malik's lips when I came through the gate with the last of the stuff. "You have passed my trials most adequately" he told me.\n\n
I asked him what trials he was talking about. We just collected some fuel and stuff for them! He explained that before he could leave, he had to make sure that whoever took over protection of [CityName] would be strong, smart and resourceful enough to handle it. So Malik had chosen five places too dangerous to bother scavenging, and sent us there to test us.
newyorkLeave_option1= Yell at Malik
newyorkLeave_option2= Bite your tongue
# both options above lead to success or fail
newyorkLeave_success= Malik once again ignored me. We saw the Riffs off on their journey eastward, then looked around their base to see what we'd inherited.\n\n
It turns out the Riffs really had thought we'd done a good job I guess, because they left us a bunch of weapons as well as plenty of food, ammo and materials. I'm glad we did our best on these "trials" to be honest, even if it was a bit overdramatic.
newyorkLeave_success_effect= Acquired the Granville Riff's base
newyorkLeave_fail= Malik once again ignored me. We saw the Riffs off on their journey eastward, then looked around their base to see what we'd inherited.\n\n
Well, not a lot really. Perhaps we aren't the "chosen ones" after all, or Malik thought we did a half-assed job of those trials. They didn't leave many supplies for us, but at least we got their territory. I just hope we have enough people to hold it all.
newyorkLeave_fail_effect= Acquired the Granville Riff's base
			
# award a perk at the end of this plotline no matter how it turned out
newyorkReward_title= On Discipline
newyorkReward_picture= arsenal
newyorkReward_pictureColin= true
newyorkReward= I have a lot of respect for Malik and the Riffs. They're focused, they work hard, and they're damn good at what they do. I hope we manage to fill their shoes now that they've gone back to New York.\n\n
What I've learned from our time with the Riffs is...
newyorkReward_option1= enforcing justice is a noble cause
newyorkReward_option2= training hard is the key to success
newyorkReward_option3= swords are cool
newyorkReward_option4= not much, actually
newyorkReward_outcome1= The Riffs considered themselves the police of [CityName]. They didn't always make the rules, but they'd uphold them no matter what.\n\n
It's a pretty honorable thing, being a cop, separating the good guys from the bad, sworn to defend civilians from the dark parts of their own hearts.\n\n
Could be I've found my calling.
newyorkReward_outcome1_effect= Gained the Police Officer perk
newyorkReward_outcome2= As Malik would say, improving oneself through training and study is a lifelong endeavor.\n\n
You never stop learning.\n\n
That's what he taught me. Body, mind and spirit, we have to keep making them better. Especially your mind as you get older. I'm going to devote more time to studying and learning new things from now on.
newyorkReward_outcome2_effect= Gained the College Student perk
newyorkReward_outcome3= Swords are the best. Also cars. And pizza. Well, at least you can still find the first two of those things around.
newyorkReward_outcome3_effect= Gained the Pizza Delivery Driver perk
newyorkReward_outcome4= Eh, Malik has more ego than brains, I think. He can intimidate people with his muscles and stupid mirrored shades, but what does he really _know_?\n\n
Karate? That's a kid's sport. Discipline's good for mindless soldiers, but survivors need to think for themselves if they want to stay alive.

# Never Trust a Pig Farmer - pig farmers, optional luddies & chosen
#
# Discover that the Pig Farmers are murderous cannibals
#
# Overview:
# Find out about pig farmers and bring them down (this level)
# Meet with pig farmers. They seem nice, if a little slimy
# Get event about survivor getting grabbed by ice cream truck. Maybe one of the other groups knows something about it?
# Cult of Chosen mention that the weekly delivery of chilled meat from the Pig Farmers comes in an ice cream truck
# Pig farmers claim to know nothing of it. If pressed, tell you to get lost.
# Luddies mention that they used to work with pig farmers, until the hard winter when almost all the pigs died, then they split off.
# Can tell you of how to sneak into base for food (or if you have good rep)
# Sneak into base, find warehouse with people
# Find your survivor and rescue them and a couple of others.
# One of the rescues say need to take out ice cream truck, setup trap, clear out square,
# Send clear out squad when empty, ice cream truck shows up, kill people inside, get truck as item
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Visit Pig Farmers and get introduced to them
farmersIntro_title= Meet Mr.Bucket's Meat
farmersIntro_picture= [FactionBackground]
farmersIntro_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
farmersIntro= Met Franky "The Slop" Bucket at his walled off farm today. Covered in mud from his battered hat to his rubber boots, he sure looked like a pig farmer.\n\n
He boasted that when the dead started rising, keeping them outside his big stone walls was nothing compared to keeping his pigs in the pen come feeding time. Told me that if we ever needed food to keep us going, that we should just to give him a holler. "This here's hard to beat - hell, might be the _only_ meat yer gonna find for sale in [CityName]."\n\n
I didn't shake his hand goodbye.

# 2. Few days later get reports of an old ice-cream truck spotted saving a couple of survivors from some zed
farmersTruckSpotting_title= The Entertainer
farmersTruckSpotting_picture= street
farmersTruckSpotting_pictureColin= false
farmersTruckSpotting= We spotted a couple survivors running from Zed from a distance. Just when it looked like they were going to be eaten, an old "Frozen Joy" ice cream truck pulled up between them and the zed, a tinny version of "The Entertainer" tinkling from it's rusted speakers.\n\n
Shotgun blasts painted the street in zombie guts and ichor. The survivors spoke to someone inside the van, then they hopped in and rode off.\n\n
You know what they used to say about getting into strange vans...

# 3. Few days later still find one of our survivors is missing. Ice Cream truck was seen in the area again. Suggest asking the other groups if they know anything. Can do any number of 4 to 6 to become suspicious of pig farmers.
farmersMissing_title= Missing Person
farmersMissing_picture= street
farmersMissing_pictureColin= false
farmersMissing_pictureColin2= false
farmersMissing= [Name] has gone missing. All we know is, [he]'d heard some music playing from outside the walls and went to investigate, but didn't come back.\n\n
There weren't any Zed around at the time, but [Name2] thought [he2] caught a glimpse of that "Frozen Joy" ice cream truck driving off. We'll need to find that truck if we want to know what happened. Maybe the other factions around here will know something.

# 4. Visit the Luddies. They don't know anything about it. Mention that they used to know the pig farmers and but split because of differences, not sure what they're up to nowadays. Also don't trust those overly-friendly cultists.
# [Name] is the missing guy
farmersLuddies1_title= Missing Person Investigation
farmersLuddies1_picture= [FactionBackground]
farmersLuddies1_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
farmersLuddies1= When I hit the Luddies encampment, "King" Ludd was fixing a big water distiller. "Needs to be 110% pure to eliminate the mind-control chemicals." When I looked skeptical he explained: "The government used to release them from weather balloons and passenger jets."\n\n
"See up there," he pointed to what looked like a harmless cloud, "the chemtrails are still in the atmosphere, and they're filling the rain with dangerous toxins. You can't take any chances with those toxins."
farmersLuddies1_option1= Ask about our missing person
farmersLuddies1_option2= Ask about the ice cream van
farmersLuddies1_outcome1= Ludd said he hadn't seen [Name] and that they certainly had nothing to do with [his] disappearance. He did have a theory though.\n\n
"Those cultists, The Chosen Ones, they've been having a drive for new members recently. They're always looking for fresh people to join their crazy zombie-worshiping religion, and we've lost a few survivors to them. I don't know how those nutters could possibly believe such crazy crap...." He went back to nervously eyeing the clouds overhead.
farmersLuddies1_outcome2= I could tell Ludd recognized the van's description, but he kept changing the subject back to his toxic cloud theory. I had to listen to another half hour of conspiracy nonsense before he fessed up.\n\n
"That ice cream van was ours," he admitted, "we used to use the loudspeakers to distract zombies on scavenging runs."\n\n
I was about to accuse him of kidnapping when Ludd put his finger up to silence me. I was worried he was pointing to the clouds again. "But, " he said, "we don't have it anymore."
farmersLuddies1_outcome2_option1= Who has the van now?
farmersLuddies1_outcome2_outcome1= Ludd explained that the Luddies hadn't always been strict vegetarians. In the early days of the infection he'd teamed up with a man named Farmer Bucket. They'd raised chickens and pigs, though Ludd himself never ate meat, because "you could never be sure what sort of dangerous hormones it might be pumped full of".\n\n
This difference in ideology came to a head one bad winter when food was scarce. Farmer Bucket split off with some others to start the Pig Farmers.\n\n
They took that old van with them when they left, so Ludd suggested we go ask them about it.

# 5. Visit Cult of Chosen. They may mention in passing that their deliveries of food (bacon, ham, long pork) come in a matching van.
farmersCult_tile= Missing Person Investigation
farmersCult_picture= [FactionBackground]
farmersCult_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
farmersCult= The area near the Church of the Chosen Ones compound was surprisingly Zed-free. I chatted with Cassandra Starr, who spoke in a voice so calm and serene you'd think she'd just had a twelve-hour massage. She was happy to answer my questions, although she kept offering me a free "What type of Zombie will you become?" personality test.\n\n
She didn't know anything about our missing person, but when I asked her about ice cream trucks she nodded. She said they regularly bought food from a truck like that, from one of the factions who had a big farm nearby.
farmersCult_option1= Ask if it was the Luddies
farmersCult_option2= Ask if it was the Pig Farmers
farmersCult_outcome1= Cassandra shrugged and said she wasn't sure. She told me that despite their ravings about government conspiracies and invisible dangers, the Luddies have some of the greenest thumbs in [CityName]. They also had an easier time trading than some other groups as the Zed didn't seem too interested in attacking caravans carrying nothing but pallets of brussels sprouts.\n\n
They might know more about the ice cream van.
farmersCult_outcome2= Cassandra smiled with a set of perfect teeth and told me the Pig Farmers always had the best meats. Their deliveries of bacon, ham and pork came regularly and were of the highest... "quality".\n\n
I'll admit, the way you could almost see the quotation marks around way she said "quality" creeped me out a bit.\n\n
She couldn't remember if the van was theirs, but maybe we should ask the Pig Farmers about the van next.

# 6. Visit Pig Farmers. They say the don't know anything about it. Get angry and defensive if you push the issue. Suggest to player that if they want to know more, needs someone good at searching (scavenging at a certain level) to find a way in or talk to someone who knows them. Maybe only show option3 after asking about the other two?
farmersFarmers_title= Missing Person Investigation
farmersFarmers_picture= [FactionBackground]
farmersFarmers_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
farmersFarmers= Judging from the mud stains, Farmer Bucket hadn't made any attempt change his clothes or wash since our last meeting. I told him that one of our people had gone missing and asked him if he had seen any ice cream trucks on the roads.\n\n
He shrugged and said he didn't know anything about any ice cream trucks, and suggested I try checking with somebody else. He said most people around here were "friendly sorts, if'n you talk to 'em right".
farmersFarmers_option1= Ask about the Chosen Ones
farmersFarmers_option2= Ask about the Luddies
# visible only after seeing option1 and 2 or immediately if having talked to another faction
farmersFarmers_option3= Insist about the ice cream truck
farmersFarmers_outcome1= Farmer Bucket smiled when I mentioned the Church. He said they were some of his best customers.\n\n
He said they've pretty much given up trying to defend themselves from the Zed, so they're trading their weapons and barricade material to Farmer Bucket for next to nothing.\n\n
"Them likes the odd cuts, " he drawled, "they take almost anything, but they specially ask for intestines and such. Guess they make their own sausage o'er there."
farmersFarmers_outcome2= Bucket sighed and told me they didn't get along with the Luddies so much. Nice enough fellas, but too paranoid. The two groups had worked together early on after the dead had started to rise, but they'd split one winter after one disagreement too many.
farmersFarmers_outcome3= Farmer Bucket clammed right up when I pushed the issue of our missing person and the suspicious ice cream truck. He told me he wasn't interested in talking any more and it was time I get off his property.\n\n
I wanted to stay and search the farm, but seeing the shotguns his boys were packing, it seems like a better idea to just go. If we're going to come back and do some poking around, we'll have to find a secret way in.

# 8. Sneak into base. Have either done 7, or done 6 and then visit with a survivor that has high enough scavenging. Describe sneaking through area. Have choice of visiting barn (9), main farm house (10), or the pigsty (11).
farmersSneak_title= Sneaking Past the Piggies
farmersSneak_picture= [FactionBackground]
farmersSneak_pictureColin= false
farmersSneak= After some surreptitious searching, we found a house next to the Pig Farmers' compound whose cellar was dug right under their big stone walls. Lucky!\n\n
We waited until dark, then broke through and came up into a damp storehouse inside their fort. It used to be full of sacks of seed and grain but even the rats had given up finding anything to nibble.\n\n
We opened the doors a crack and saw three major buildings in the distance: an old stable close to the main gate, a rustic farmhouse, and a long pig barn in the back of the compound.
farmersSneak_option1= Investigate the stable
farmersSneak_option2= Investigate the farmhouse
farmersSneak_option3= Investigate the pig barn

# 9. Find the barn is empty, save for an old ice cream truck. Nothing inside truck. Can visit main farm house (10) or pigsty (11).
farmersStable_title= This Piggy Went To Market
farmersStable_picture= [FactionBackground]
farmersStable_pictureColin= false
farmersStable= We made it into the old stable without any trouble. The couple of guys watching the gate were more interested in what was going on outside to notice anything happening inside the compound.\n\n
Inside there were a few old tools resting underneath some impressive cobwebs, and a serviceable if slightly rusted "Frozen Joy" ice cream truck.\n\n
We took a quick look in the truck, but it was empty aside from a couple of deep freezes, stagnant water and old popsicle wrappers. We couldn't find the keys, so we decided to move on before anyone found us.
farmersStable_option1= Investigate the farm house
farmersStable_option2= Investigate the pig barn

# 10. Can't get too close, but looks like the farmers are having a BBQ. Don't see anything unusual. Can visit
farmersHouse_title= This Little Piggy Stayed Home
farmersHouse_picture= [FactionBackground]
farmersHouse_pictureColin= false
farmersHouse= As we neared the house we could see a few lights on and heard muffled laughter from inside. From the smell of something cooking, it looked like they were having a big barbecue of some sort.\n\n
We couldn't get too close without being spotted, but at least we knew most of the Pig Farmers were busy. We'll have to look elsewhere until everyone settles down for the night.
farmersHouse_option1= Investigate the stable
farmersHouse_option2= Investigate the pig barn

# 11. The pigsty is empty and doesn't look like it's been used for a long time. It does connect to the slaughter house however.
farmersPigbarn_title= This Little Piggy Had None
farmersPigbarn_picture= [FactionBackground]
farmersPigbarn_pictureColin= false
farmersPigbarn= We crept through the side doors of the massive barn, trying not to wake any beasts within. It turned out there was no need; there was a total lack of anything pig-shaped inside. From the rusted troughs and bone dry earth in the stalls, nothing had been living there for awhile.\n\n
There were plenty of footprints though, so we followed those deeper into cavernous barn. We passed stall after empty stall, gates falling off their hinges, the cobwebs getting so thick it looked like the spiders were trying to communicate.\n\n
The footprints headed out a side exit and up a ramp to an unlit concrete building.
farmersPigbarn_option1= Walk up the ramp

# 12. Find human bodies hanging from slaughterhouse. Hear banging from one of the meat lockers. When open, find survivor + others. (outcome1 leads to outcome2)
# This Little Piggy Had Roast Beef
farmersSlaughterhouse_title= This Little Piggy
farmersSlaughterhouse_picture= [FactionBackground]
farmersSlaughterhouse_pictureColin= false
farmersSlaughterhouse= The smell of blood and offal hit us at the top of the ramp. We had entered the slaughterhouse.\n\n
From the light filtering through the high windows, we could see bloodstains caking the runoffs all over the walls. Chains and curved hooks hung from the rafters, jingling slightly in the breeze. Large knives lined the walls near the butchers blocks.\n\n
Off to the side we could see two large freezer doors. There was a scratching noise coming from the one on the left.
farmersSlaughterhouse_option1= Open the right door
farmersSlaughterhouse_option2= Open the left door
# continues to outcome2
farmersSlaughterhouse_outcome1= A waft of cold air blew past us as we opened the door and looked into the room beyond. Silent forms dangled from meathooks along the ceiling and walls.\n\n
The carcasses were badly mangled and partially skinned, so it took a us awhile to realize the shapes on the hooks didn't quite look like pigs. They were leaner. They had hands. And feet.\n\n
Retching, I turned and groped at a nearby wall to steady myself. I hit the handle of the left freezer door by accident....
farmersSlaughterhouse_outcome1_option1= Continue...
farmersSlaughterhouse_outcome2= The door swung open and our missing survivor, [Name], fell out onto the floor. Inside the freezer other captives slumped and started vacantly at nothing.\n\n
[We] lifted [Name] to a sitting position and tried to get [him] to focus. [He] blinked blearily for a second then shouted: "They're cannibals! They don't eat pigs, they eat people! The pork is people!!"\n\n
At that moment the green fluorescent lights of the slaughterhouse suddenly flickered to life. [We] turned to find Farmer Bucket standing behind [us], a shotgun aimed at my head.
farmersSlaughterhouse_outcome2_option1= Continue...

# 13. Head farmer shows up. Explains your survivor saw them cutting apart a dead body, they just wanted to keep him quiet. Convince them it was OK, they only hunt bad people. They survived the winter by eating a dead guy, which is why they and the Luddies split. You have option of agreeing not to tell anyone and leaving peacefully (goto 14), or fighting your way out (goto 15).
farmersDiscovery_title= Soylent Green
farmersDiscovery_picture= [FactionBackground]
farmersDiscovery_pictureColin= [factionLeader]
farmersDiscovery= When Farmer Bucket saw [Name] next to [us], he sighed. "Yuss", he admitted, "our meat ain't made of pigs no more since they's all dead. Yuss, it's people meat... but only bad ones!"\n\n
He said the Pig Farmers only took people who attacked them first. Raiders, thieves, and murderers who preyed on the weak. [Name] was an accident; [he]'d seen too much and they were just holding [him] until they figured out how to explain the situation.\n\n
He offered [us] a deal. If [we] agree to keep [our] [p|mouth|mouths] shut, [we] could walk off the farm then and there.
farmersDiscovery_option1= Agree to stay quiet
farmersDiscovery_option2= Fight our way out

# 14. You agree not to tell anyone, get rep + reward. Can bring just your survivor (goto 17), or others as well (goto 16).
# Name gets extra unhappiness because you made a deal

farmersAgreement_title= Soylent Green
farmersAgreement_picture= [FactionBackground]
farmersAgreement_pictureColin= [factionLeader]
farmersAgreement= [Name] wasn't happy about it, but we shook hands with Farmer Bucket and agreed to keep his secret safe. He thanked us and even gave us some old farming tools they didn't need.\n\n
As we were leaving, [Name] asked about the other guys in the meat locker. Bucket said we could take them too, if we wanted, but he wouldn't advise it. They were "bad folks" and "scum who ain't good for nuthin' but the meat on they bones".
farmersAgreement_option1= Take the other 3 prisoners with us
farmersAgreement_option2= Leave the other 3 prisoners behind
farmersAgreement_outcome1= While they still seemed a bit dazed from living in a meat locker for weeks, they were grateful for the freedom and agreed to join our crew.
# even more unhappiness for Name
farmersAgreement_outcome2= [Name] was upset about leaving the others in Farmer Bucket's clutches, but [he]'ll get over it.

# 15. Head farmer gets injured and a number of their guys get killed. Pig farmers weakened and rep goes to 0. Maybe get weapons from escape? Can bring just your survivor (goto 17), or others as well (goto 16).
# Name gets happiness bonus for taking revenge
# farmers are destroyed

farmersFight= I edged back to the table with the knives on it while Bucket drawled on about eating murderers. I felt behind me for a handle then flung it directly at him. Bucket looked down at the cleaver lodged in his gut, stunned, then raised his shotgun and started blasting.\n\n
The other prisoners from the freezer came out of their daze and rushed him, clawing and screaming. That's our signal to go!
farmersFight_option1= Take the other 3 prisoners with us
farmersFight_option2= Leave the other 3 prisoners behind
farmersFight_outcome1= While they still seemed a bit dazed from living in a meat locker for weeks, they were grateful for the freedom and agreed to join our crew.\n\n
We got the hell out of there as fast as we could. We were lucky to escape the compound unharmed, especially [Name] who went out of [his] way to kill several other farmers as revenge.
farmersFight_outcome1_option1= The next day...
# unhappiness for Name
farmersFight_outcome2= [Name] was upset about leaving the others, but [he]'ll get over it.\n\n
We got the hell out of there as fast as we could. We were lucky to escape the compound unharmed, especially [Name] who went out of [his] way to kill several other farmers as revenge.
farmersFight_outcome2_option1= The next day...
farmersFightNextDay= We spotted a convoy of trucks leaving from the Pig Farmer's fort, headed by the infamous "Frozen Joy" ice cream truck. We were worried they were coming our way for revenge, but they made for the highway instead and left town.\n\n
I'm still not sure if Farmer Bucket survived or not, but it looks like they didn't think it was a good idea to stick around in [CityName] now that their secret is out.\n\n
They left their gates open when they left, allowing a stampede of Zed to repopulate the place.

# 16. If brought other psychos with you, they start to cause trouble in your fort until you kick them out.
# Name is one of the three little piggies
# Name2 is injured, -10 food, suburb or apartment reduced to rubble
# they all have bad perks
farmersMistake_title= The Three Little Piggies
farmersMistake= In hindsight we shouldn't have let those prisoners from the Pig Farmers join us. They drank through half our liquor supply, left a gate open, and stabbed [FormalName] in a fight over some purple horse doll.\n\n
I was heading over to talk with them when I heard them arguing over that doll again. There was a shot, then a moment later two more. Looks like they killed each other after a three-way Mexican standoff.\n\n
We've lost [a] [square] and [Name] needs time to recover.

# award a perk at the end of this plotline no matter how it turned out
farmersReward_title= On Summer Jobs
farmersReward_picture= happy
farmersReward_pictureColin= true
farmersReward= This ugly business with the Pig Farmers brought back memories of a summer job I once took, working for a local farm. I had these romantic ideas of farm life being healthy and natural, getting fresh air and being in touch with nature.\n\n
Instead I spent 8 hours a day shoveling and spreading cow manure.\n\n
To amuse myself, I...
# all lead to the same next option
farmersReward_option1= Listened to loud angry music on my headphones
farmersReward_option2= Played poop-related pranks on the farm owners
farmersReward_option3= Communed with the cows
farmersReward_outcome1= After that I vowed I'd never work on a farm again, but who could have guessed farming would become such an important part of our lives again?\n\n
Anyway, my next summer was much better. I...
farmersReward_outcome1_option1= Worked as a Shop Clerk
farmersReward_outcome1_option2= Did Construction Work
farmersReward_outcome1_option3= Learned to Program
farmersReward_outcome1_option4= Lay around and did nothing
farmersReward_outcome1_outcome1= All my friends came by to hang out at the corner store where I worked that summer. We talked about our favorite movies and stuff and basically nothing happened. Pretty much the plot to the movie Clerks.
farmersReward_outcome1_outcome1_effect= Gained the Shop Clerk perk
farmersReward_outcome1_outcome2= We built decks and refinished kitchens for big houses in the suburbs. I only put a nail through my hand _once_, and it wasn't my fault.
farmersReward_outcome1_outcome2_effect= Gained the Construction Worker perk
farmersReward_outcome1_outcome3= I did some amateur coding, made websites for local businesses and wrote a video game with a couple friends. None of it really took off, but I learned a lot in the process.\n\n
Sure, programming isn't a real relevant skill anymore. Hopefully it will be again someday... 
farmersReward_outcome1_outcome3_effect= Gained the Programmer perk
farmersReward_outcome1_outcome4= Nothing better than a real summer vacation. Going to the lake with my buds, staying up late every night, and most of all lying on the couch with absolutely no responsibilities in the world.\n\n
God, how I envy that younger me right now.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Visit government. See Shiona wheeling zombie in. Thought it sounded like it called for help. Can ask about it. Davis diverts, Shiona tries to tell but Davis steps in.
superCapturedZed_title= Rank and Vile
superCapturedZed_picture= [FactionBackground]
superCapturedZed_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
superCapturedZed_pictureColin2= whyte
superCapturedZed= I'd just finished negotiations with Senator Davis and was leaving her office as two soldiers wheeled a live zombie past on a gurney. The creature fought against the straps holding it down, grotesquely sawing them into its own skin.\n\n
An older woman in a lab coat followed them. She gave us a tired smile then stopped to consult her clipboard. As the zombie was rolled away I could have sworn it snarled something in English, something like "Damn dirty apes!"
superCapturedZed_option1= Ask Davis about the zombie
superCapturedZed_option2= Ask older woman about the zombie
superCapturedZed_outcome1= Davis shuffled the papers on her desk and said something dismissive about soldiers needing target practice. I suggested they could just fire at Zed over the wall without needing to capture them alive (dead? undead?). This got a snort out of the woman in the lab coat. "That'd sure make _my_ job easier!" she joked.\n\n
The senator glared at both of us. "The soldiers need controlled conditions, " she said. "Now if you'll excuse us, I have something to discuss with Dr. Whyte here, which is _also_ none of your business, citizen."
superCapturedZed_outcome2= The woman introduced herself as Dr. Whyte. When I asked about the Zed, she perked up, saying "It's fascinating. It's virtually a new species. These ones seem almost...", before Senator Davis cooly stepped between us.\n\n
"This is classified information Dr. Whyte, " she said. "Not something average citizens need to know."\n\n
To avoid any further "distractions", the senator ordered a soldier to escort [us] out.


# 4. This event is displayed 2-3 days after last event. No actual mission associated with it. See zombie watching who runs when spotted. Can chase, or not, they're the same and it escapes either way.
superRunner_title= The Running Dead
superRunner_picture= cornerZombie
superRunner_pictureColin= false
superRunner= We were on the way home from a mission over near the Government base when I caught sight of a head peering out at us from behind a wall. Between the sunken eyes, patchy hair, and missing jaw, it looked distinctly unfriendly.\n\n
However when we raised our weapons, instead of running at us teeth first like your usual Zed, it turned and bolted down a side street.
superRunner_option1= Chase it down
superRunner_option2= Let it go
superRunner_outcome1= We ran after it, but even with its limp, the thing was surprisingly fast. We lost sight of it after it darted into a nearby McNoodles.\n\n
I followed it in, but after slipping on an old take out container, I found I needed a minute to just lie on the floor and watch the broken ceiling fan turn slowly in the breeze. Then a shadow stepped over me and reached out a hand to help me up...
superRunner_outcome1_option1= Take the hand
superRunner_outcome2= Weird that it would run off like that... but I didn't think it was worth the risk to chase after it through the city. We left it be. So we were surprised as hell when we rounded a corner two blocks later and the creature was standing there like it had been waiting for us.
superRunner_outcome2_option1= See what it wants
# outcome of both Take the hand and See what it wants
superRunnerTalk= "Uh... hi," said the zombie slowly. "I'm... I'm Two-Arms... Two-Arms Reginald."\n\n
Turns out he wasn't a zombie, but a member of the Rotten, and he'd managed to catch the disease and live... sort of. His skin was coming off in patches, his jaw was mostly missing, and though he did indeed have two arms, one of them had fallen off and was tied to his side.\n\n
"I thought... you were the Government." he said. "They're out... out... to get us. Ask Jesse. Jesse.... will tell you."\n\n
We let the odd fellow go.

# after meeting with rotten
# 6. Visit rotten. Get partial explanation of rotten. Jesse asks for help getting their person back from government. Can agree or tell to go to hell. Display the _end text regardless of which option they pick.
superVisit_title= Trash Heap Blues
superVisit_picture= [FactionBackground]
superVisit_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
superVisit= When [we] met with Jesse, he told [us] a story of a young girl who'd been bitten and locked in a closet by her parents who didn't have the heart to kill her. Jesse found her three weeks later, terrified, half-mad, but still alive.\n\n
"The disease changes us, " he said. "But our hearts still thump and our heads still think... well mostly. "\n\n
"So it's an insult to my kin that someone's been snatching us Rotten. Taking folks away, young and old. Care to wager who's doing it?"
superVisit_option1= Guess the Government
superVisit_option2= Guess the bogeyman
superVisit_option3= It's none of my business
superVisit_outcome1= "Bullseye!" said Jesse. "The Rotten are tougher than a two-dollar steak, and the Government's experimenting on us to find out why. The last fella they picked up was our engineer Chucklin' Chuck. He had plans to secure this subway and stop the Government raids for good, but they snagged him before he got started."\n\n
Jesse's offering a reward for Chuck's safe return, but he warned that the Government wouldn't take lightly to interference, especially if they thought we were working with the Rotten.
superVisit_outcome2= Jesse chuckled. "Close enough. It's those play-acting sheriffs from the Government. They're testing on us, experiments and such." He shook his head. "The last fella they picked up was Chucklin' Chuck our engineer. He had plans to wall off our place and stop the Government raids for good, but they snagged him before he got started."\n\n
Jesse's offering a reward for Chuck's safe return, but he warned that the Government wouldn't take lightly to interference, especially if they thought we were working with the Rotten.
superVisit_outcome3= Jesse sighed. "When the Government starts raiding you next, will it still be none of your business?"\n\n
"They're experimenting on us, it ain't humane. The last fella they picked up was Chucklin' Chuck our engineer. He had plans to wall off our place and stop the Government raids for good, if they hadn't snagged him."\n\n
Jesse's offering a reward for Chuck's safe return, but he warned that the Government wouldn't take lightly to interference, especially if they thought we were working with the Rotten.

# 7. Visit government and see Miguel. Can ask about prisoner or tell about visiting rotten. Quest splits here (Help rotten 8-15, Help Government 16-20) so needs to be obvious this is a big choice.
superChoice_title= Picking Sides
superChoice_picture= [FactionBackground]
superChoice_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
superChoice= This is awkward. During [our] meeting with Senator Davis, she asked if we'd seen any strange zombies in the city... zombies who could talk and use tools. She must mean the Rotten, who say the Government has been kidnapping and experimenting on them.\n\n
This is our chance to find out what happened to "Chucklin' Chuck"... or we could help the Government by telling them what we know about the Rotten's fort and leader.
superChoice_option1= Ask about Chuck
superChoice_option2= Tell her about the Rotten
superChoice_outcome1= Davis gave a sour look when I mentioned the captured Rotten.\n\n
"Chapter 3, Article 8b of the UN Charter states that any individuals infected by zombieism are no longer classified as human and retain no rights or privileges as such."\n\n
I tried to press the matter but she shut me down with words like "Classified", "Confidential", and "Restricted". I guess we aren't going to learn any more from her.
superChoice_outcome1_option1= Look elsewhere...
superChoice_outcome2= "You actually spoke with them?" this clearly stunned Senator Davis. "How many were there? Where is the main entrance to their camp? Have you filled out an incident report?"\n\n
She called in a secretary to take detailed notes on our experiences with Jesse and the Rotten. I noticed she consistently referred to them as "zombies". Jesse wouldn't approve.
superChoice_outcome2_option1= Continue...

# ---- help the rotten

# 8. Ask about prisoner, Miguel tells you to get lost. Get approached by Shiona as you leave. Tells you if you can prove this is a citizen, Miguel's bureaucracy would force him to let Rotten go.
superShiona_title= Bright Eyes
superShiona_picture= [FactionBackground]
superShiona_pictureColin= whyte
superShiona= We tracked down Dr. Whyte, who seemed to know something about the zombies being held here.\n\n
"Oh my yes, " she gushed. "We're making wonderful progress in our experiments with the Rotten. They don't need to eat and their cutaneous receptors no longer react to pain or heat, yet they still score well on the Hopkins manual dexterity test. It's as if their bodies have bonded with the virus, rather than being taken over by it."\n\n
"If we could produce a similar state in our soldiers, they'd be far more effective in combat."
superShiona_option1= You'll infect your own people??
superShiona_option2= Where are you keeping Chuck?
superShiona_outcome1= The doctor huffed at this. "With their consent, of course. What soldier wouldn't be proud to risk their lives for the state, after everything we've been through?"\n\n
"We are offering them increased strength, immunity to pain, the ability to take a bullet and keep going. We just need to iron out a few kinks first. Such as the rotting flesh." She made a face. "They do smell quite awful."
superShiona_outcome2= She seemed saddened at the mention of the Rotten's name. "Oh, him," she said. "it's a shame that one so bright-eyed and intelligent must be the subject of our tests. But by the UN Charter he is no longer considered human."\n\n
"Unless... Chapter 3, Article 8c states that infected entities may regain rights if they can articulate that they are a citizen of a UN country and provide documentation for it. He can still talk well enough, but doesn't have any ID on him. Maybe someone at the Rotten fort could help find it."

# 9. Visit rotten, and tell about plan. Jesse tells you where captured rotten used to live.
superVisit2_title= Speak With The Dead
superVisit2_picture= [FactionBackground]
superVisit2_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
superVisit2= We met up with Jesse and explained the situation with Chucklin' Chuck. He slapped his head, almost dislodging his loose ear. "Well beat me like a rented mule! That's simple. All we need is some sort of identification papers for old Chuck and they'll have to let him go."\n\n
"Not that most of these folk carry ID any more. But Chuck... Chuck was a local. He had a place right here in [CityName]." He pointed us to an unclaimed suburban area. "Might find his papers there, if anywhere."

# mission in suburbs
# first person, reporter is the mentionedcolin who might get injured
# 10. Scavenge captured Rotten's old place. See Zed can either shoot way through (11) or sneak past (12).
superChucksPlace_title= Beware the Beast Man
superChucksPlace_picture= house
superChucksPlace_pictureColin= false
superChucksPlace= Chuck's house had obviously cost him a bit back when money had meant something. Unfortunately, judging from the teeth marks, the Zed had little respect for natural wood columns, and the floor to ceiling windows hadn't helped much with fortifying the place.\n\n
As [we] got near the house [we] spotted movement through the broken windows and a couple disheveled figures crouched over a fallen body inside. From the sounds of cracking bone and tearing flesh, [we] [were] pretty sure they weren't giving the guy CPR.
superChucksPlace_option1= Fight the Zed (defense roll)
superChucksPlace_option2= Sneak past (luck)

# roll against defense 15 to avoid injury
# 11. If scout has high enough combat, kills zed, otherwise gets injured. Gets ID either way.
superChucksPlace_outcome1_success= I grabbed a metal pipe and caved in the first zed's head before it could look up from its meal. The second snarled as I shoved the pipe into its mouth and forced it to the ground. As the creature flailed under me, I raised my foot and brought it down on the zed's head, once, twice, three times. On the third strike the thing's skull split like a ripe melon.\n\n
It took a few hours of searching the house after that to find an old passport belonging to a one "Charlton Taylor". Now we just need to get this to Chuck in the Government's compound.
superChucksPlace_outcome1_fail= The creatures leapt up from their meal and charged. I hit the first in the head as it came through the window at [us], but the second knocked me to the ground and clawed me up pretty bad before I shoved a piece of glass through its eye.\n\n
I'm pretty banged up and doc says I need a few days to rest, but I'm not bit, and I managed to find Chuck's passport in that house before [we] left. Just have to bring that to him now in the Government base.

# 12. 50/50 roll, gets in without being spotted, otherwise gets injured. Gets ID either way.
superChucksPlace_outcome2_success= I crept round the other side of the house and slipped in a side entrance made up the steps to the second floor unseen.\n\n
Sweat wouldn't stop dripping down the back of my neck as I went from room to room, but I made quick work of the search and soon found Chuck's passport in a side table.\n\n
The bad part came as I hit the bottom of the stairs and stepped on some broken glass from one of the windows, catching the attention of the Zed in the other room. Fortunately I can be quite the sprinter when I need to be, so everything worked out in the end.
superChucksPlace_outcome2_fail= I climbed a trellis and through a window on the second floor, bypassing the Zed inside. It took a few hours but I found Chuck's passport in a side table.\n\n
Unfortunately by that point the Zed had finished their meal downstairs and were starting to wander the rest of the house. I bolted, but slipped halfway down the trellis and twisted my ankle.\n\n
Then a zombie jumped out the window after me and chased me through the city for an hour at hobbling-speed. It hurt.

# 13. Return to government, show ID and site regulation Shiona told you about. Miguel captured Rotten go.
# (Lose Government rep)
superFreedom_title= Out of the mad house
superFreedom_picture= [FactionBackground]
superFreedom_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
superFreedom_pictureColin2= whyte
superFreedom= Senator Davis was not amused when we stormed in with Chucklin' Chuck's passport and demanded he have his rights reinstated as per Chapter 3, Article 8c of the UN Charter. She was still in furious denial when there was a knock at the door.\n\n
Dr. Whyte led in in a green-skinned man on a neck leash. "Now Chuck, can you tell them what you've been telling me?" she asked. Chuck snatched his passport from me and declared in a clear voice that he was a legal citizen of this state and had the right to his freedom.
superFreedom_option1= Continue...
superFreedom_outcome1= The senator was nonplussed, but she finally agreed to let Chuck go, despite the fact that his passport had expired years ago and was no longer legal identification.\n\n
It seemed she considered the political ramifications of fighting both us and the Rotten over this, and decided some test subject wasn't worth starting a war over.\n\n
Chuck thanked us, and gave Dr. Whyte a kiss on the cheek which made her cringe, then blush furiously.

# 15. Visit rotten. rotten take over the government fort, government destroyed, big +respect with rotten
superRottenEnd_title= You Maniacs!
superRottenEnd_picture= [FactionBackground]
superRottenEnd_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
superRottenEnd= The Rotten's fort was eerily quiet when [we] arrived. I was wondering where everyone had gone when [we] heard a terrible grinding and squealing of metal. An enormous army tank rounded the street corner, then another. I just had time to think "Oh no - the Government!" when the first tank stopped and Jesse popped his head out.\n\n
He tipped his hat to [us]. "Howdy [p|friend|friends]! Pleasant day to take down the Government, don't you reckon?" He made gunning motions with his fingers. "Boom!" "Kaboom!"
superRottenEnd_option1= You blew it up??
superRottenEnd_outcome1= "Better," he grinned. "We took it over!"\n\n
He explained that Chucklin' Chuck had learned the layout of the Government's base during his time there, and led an attack force in through a maintenance shaft to take the place down from the inside. Most of the Government ran when they saw they'd lost, and now the Rotten control their territory.
superRottenEnd_outcome1_option1= Condemn the violence
superRottenEnd_outcome1_option2= Agree it had to be done
superRottenEnd_outcome1_outcome1= Jesse sighed. "Chuck feels alike to you in that regard. The old burr didn't want to shed blood, we had to trick him into it. He didn't take kindly to the way we treated his 'friends' in there neither. But how can you call a man your friend after he's had you on a leash?"\n\n
"I dunno. But I reckon old Chuck's looking for a new home now, if your lot could offer that."
superRottenEnd_outcome1_outcome1_option1= Let Chuck join us
superRottenEnd_outcome1_outcome1_option2= Refuse Chuck
superRottenEnd_outcome1_outcome2= Jesse nodded. "You bet your boots we had to. That Senator, she wouldn't quit 'till she had her an army of Rotten supersoldiers. It's too bad she hightailed it out of there, probably off to beurocrate some other town half to death."\n\n
"Listen, we owe you for your part in this rodeo. Chuck'd be willing to hang his boots at your fort for awhile, if you could make use of an engineer with a little rot on his skin. How bout it?"
superRottenEnd_outcome1_outcome2_option1= Let Chuck join us
superRottenEnd_outcome1_outcome2_option2= Refuse Chuck
# "Chucklin'" Chuck is a high level rotten engineer, he'll start with +happiness if we condemned the violence earlier
# he comes equipped with a KS_SCIENCE_BOOK
superRottenEnd_join= The others are nervous to have one of the Rotten living with us, but as his nickname implies, Chuck does have a good sense of humor. I think they'll warm up to him in time.
superRottenEnd_refuse= No offense to Chuck, but I don't think we'd feel comfortable with a Rotten in our midst. I mean, they say they aren't infectious, but I'm not sure I believe it. Or, what if the disease up and swallowed him one night and he woke with a sudden urge to eat people? We can't take that chance.

# ---- help the government after # 7. Picking Sides

# 17. Davis offers bounty on any captured rotten.
superDavis_title= Human see, human do
superDavis_picture= [FactionBackground]
superDavis_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
superDavis= Davis stood and paced around her office.\n\n
"These creatures trust you," she said thoughtfully. "And you know that we are bringing them here as part of our primary goal to defeat the undead disease and re-establish order in this country."\n\n
"We've had some preliminary success, but recently they've become more... reticent to leave the confines of their camp if they know our men are near. You might have better luck procuring test subjects for us."
# adds potential quest to capture rotten
superDavis_option1= Agree to capture Rotten
superDavis_option2= Say you're not interested
superDavis_outcome1= I told Senator Davis we'd help her and she almost cracked a smile. "Wonderful. You will of course be compensated for your work as civil servants."\n\n
Davis suggested we send a squad to clear out the zombies beside the Rotten's base. We could kill the ones that tried to eat our brains and capture the rest.
superDavis_outcome2= The senator frowned deeply when I told her we wouldn't capture more Rotten for them.\n\n
"That is unfortunate. Don't let me detain you any longer than necessary." With that, a powerful hand gripped my shoulder and began moving me purposely towards the exit.

# 18. Didn't agree to help in 17. several days later,
# high-level survivor kidnapped (dies) by men in black vans. Get ransom message from government.
# adds potential quest to capture rotten
superKidnap_title= Get your stinking paws off me
superKidnap_picture= bedroom
superKidnap_pictureColin= true
superKidnap= [Name] went missing during the night. When we searched his room we found [his] bed empty and a very businesslike ransom note on his pillow.\n\n
It explained that [Name] was being detailed by the Government for an indefinite period while [he] helped with their research. They will require him until new test subjects are found.\n\n
I guess we either go hunting for Rotten now, or we punch our way into the Government base and rescue both [Name] and Chucklin' Chuck.

# 19. Spawn "Hunt Rotten" quest mission on all nonfort squares adjacent or diagonal to the rotten fort
# if none are found, pick a nonfort square further away, or spawn one if necessary
# they are dangerous missions, can only run one at a time

# kills all zombies on the square when complete
superHunt1_title= Zombie Hunting, Day 1
superHunt1_picture= cornerZombie
superHunt1_pictureColin= false
superHunt1= We captured a good number of Rotten today and blew holes in the heads of some of the less talkative undead in the area. It's not enough to fill the Government's quota, but it's a start. Two more days should do it.
superHunt2_title= Zombie Hunting, Day 2
superHunt2_picture= cornerZombie
superHunt2_pictureColin= false
superHunt2= We managed to catch a few more Rotten today, but I think they're beginning to suspect we're up to something. That became was pretty obvious when we stuffed bags over the heads of the ones who came to ask us why we were there.\n\n
I feel bad doing it, but this is bigger than them. The Government is bigger than all of us.
superHunt3_title= Zombie Hunting, Day 3
superHunt3_picture= cornerZombie
superHunt3_pictureColin= false
superHunt3= The Rotten went into hiding as soon as we got near, so we only caught a few today. One was an older Rotten named Two-Arms Reginald. It seemed he'd lost his other arm while we were chasing him, the one he usually carries around, and was whimpering pathetically about it. I felt sorry for him, but there are so many arms lying in any given street, I have no idea which might be his.\n\n
This should be enough for the Government, and anyway these guys are on to us.

# 20. Visit government. Davis takes rotten away.
# rotten fort destroyed, big +respect with government faction
# kidnapped guy returned if kidnapped
superGovernmentReward_title= Pieces of Silver
superGovernmentReward_picture= [FactionBackground]
superGovernmentReward_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
superGovernmentReward= We delivered the captured Rotten of to Senator Davis. She looked grimly satisfied as she went down the line of miserable creatures we had assembled. Most seemed resigned to their fate, but a few still had the energy to make a spirited attempt at biting at her as she passed by.\n\n
Davis thanked us for our commitment to the cause and traded us a selection of high powered government issue rifles that looked like they had seen better days.
superGovernmentReward_option1= Thank her
# visible only if someone was kidnapped in #18
superGovernmentReward_option2= Ask about our kidnapped survivor
# both outcomes loop back to the two options until both have been seen
superGovernmentReward_outcome1= The senator saluted us. "For your exemplary work in the field, citizens."\n\n
"Oh," she added, "you don't need to worry about the remaining Rotten. Now that we have what we need, I've sent a detachment to seal up their little hole and eliminate the rest of their brood. I'm afraid they were too dangerous to have walking around [CityName] like that."\n\n
And that was the end of the Rotten, I guess.
superGovernmentReward_outcome2= Davis feigned ignorance at the word "kidnap", then appeared to remember. "Oh yes, you mean the [job] who was helping with our research. I suppose [he] can return to your fort now."\n\n
She had me worried for a moment there.

# Alternate end: If you attack and destroy government base on your own after 6 but before 13 or 20

superForcedFreedom_title= Out of the mad house
superForcedFreedom_picture= [FactionBackground]
superForcedFreedom_pictureColin= false
superForcedFreedom= After bringing down the Government base, we found Chucklin' Chuck and a few other Rotten locked up in a cell in the basement.\n\n
They were happy to be free, but I wasn't sure I liked the way they were licking their lips as they passed the dead soldiers that we'd left littering the base.
# show this instead if our guy was kidnapped in #18, rescue him too, comes back to life
superForcedFreedomKidnap_pictureColin= true
superForcedFreedomKidnap= We found [Name] wandering outside the Government base as we left. Apparently Dr. Whyte had come and let [him] free while the soldiers were busy dealing with us.\n\n
While [he] hadn't been badly treated, [he] didn't think they would have let [him] go even if we fulfilled our part of the bargain.\n\n
Just goes to show you can never trust anyone in politics.

superReward_picture= rubble
superReward_pictureColin= true
superReward= I can't imagine living out my days in a filthy subway, hiding from people who want to hunt me down and cut up my brain. Nope, not the way I imagined my old age happening.\n\n
Back before all this end of the world zombieism nonsense, I had other plans. When I got on in years, I was going to...
superReward_option1= retire early
superReward_option2= manage a real estate empire
superReward_option3= become a hobo and travel the land
superReward_option4= be eaten by the undead
superReward_outcome1= Retirement by 40, that was my goal. It just takes a few good investments, a bit of thriftiness, and some seriously lowered expectations of lifestyle and comfort.\n\n
I'd have been perfectly happy in my little one-bedroom apartment, just whiling away the time playing checkers with the boys at the rotary club and hunting for those early bird specials.\n\n
Well, no reason I can't add a little retirement ethos to my current life. You're never too old... I mean young.
superReward_outcome1_effect= Gained the Retiree perk
superReward_outcome2= It was just a dream, but I imagined myself as a real estate developer, closing big deals to turn parking lots into office buildings.\n\n
I'd have other people do the real work of course, but I'd go down to the site once a month and tell everybody to work smarter, not harder. Then I'd also tell them to work harder.\n\n
I guess I can apply some of this ethos to my leadership in [CityName]. Everybody! Get back to work!
superReward_outcome2_effect= Gained the Real Estate Developer perk
superReward_outcome3= Riding the rails. Wandering the earth. Taking jobs where I could find them, and meeting all kinds of strange and wonderful people.\n\n
I guess this life I'm leading is an extension of that. Moving from town to town, fixing things up and making it safe for other people to settle down. But not me. I just keep moving on.\n\n
So I'm already a hobo if you think of it that way. Life goal: achieved.
superReward_outcome3_effect= Gained the Hobo perk
superReward_outcome4= Strangely, I predicted the outbreak years before it actually happened. After SARS and Ebola, I knew this was how it would end for humanity. The infected would rise, the living fall.\n\n
I just thought I'd be one of the first to go.\n\n
Imagine my surprise to live through it all, so far anyway. And I've even been bitten! I guess you can't stop me!

# Villain - A New Breed (Castlegar)
#
# One of the Rotten that was experimented on by the government has gained the power to control the Zed
# Rotten is none too happy with humanity after that.
# The Zed will be more organized from here on out. (More likely to move towards/attack bases, or cluster around evil master's home while quest is ongoing?)
# New zed behavior, move into locations that are being cleared out? Or would that just be frustrating?
#
# This quest starts earlier than most quests, like when you're 1/2 way to the squares goal
#

villainTools_picture= pawnshop
villainTools_pictureColin1= true
villainTools= Okay, so, the zombies in this [square] are weird. Different. They seem to know how to use tools, at least rudimentary ones.\n\n
I saw one turn a door knob earlier today before I took its head off, and killed another one clutching a mobile phone. Now one of them is lurching through the hall towards [us] with a pair of scissors. It's opening and closing them like it's trying to cut something. This is pretty unusual behavior for zed.
villainTools_option1= Talk to it
villainTools_option2= Kill it
villainTools_outcome1= "Uh, hail! We mean you no harm! What are you doing with those scissors?" I asked as the creature jammed them into my collarbone.\n\n
This zombie had once been an elderly woman, possibly a seamstress judging from her skill with those shears. Her scalp was half ripped off, flapping at the back of her head. I grabbed it and pulled her away from me.\n\n
I got a good look in her eyes before I killed her. No signs of intelligence there. But tool-using zombies are a terrifying thought. I hope we don't see more.
villainTools_outcome2= Done. This zombie - now an ex-zombie - had once been an elderly woman, possibly a seamstress from the way she held those shears. I couldn't see any signs of intelligence, just the empty hunger that all zed share.\n\n
But why the tools? Regular zombies can't make anything but claws with their hands, and their only weapons are their teeth. Tool-using zombies are a terrifying thought. I hope we don't see more.

# 2. Event Occurs: Random survivor almost caught by zed ambush. They seem to be acting a bit more intelligent.

villainClever_pictureColin1= true
villainClever_1= [We] had a successful day of [missioning] at the [square]. I found [a] {1}, and didn't see any zed... until the way back.\n\n
Ten or twenty of them. They were moaning and shambling after [us] like typical undead, but then half of them split off down a side street. Odd.\n\n
[We] picked up the pace, staying ahead of them, but didn't know the streets too well and got turned around. Suddenly there was the other half of them ahead of [us]. I accidentally dropped the {1} in my fear.\n\n
They charged.
villainClever_option1= Go back for the {1}
villainClever_option2= Leave it and run
# roll scavenging vs 8, get {1} whether success or failure
villainClever_outcome1_succeed= [We] grabbed the {1} and dodged down an alley, without even knowing if it had an exit. Luckily there was no dead end, and [we] [were] fast enough to get some distance on the two groups. [We] eventually got [our] bearings and found [our] way home.\n\n
Those were definitely zombies.. I think. But zombies splitting up and taking short cuts? Zombies using tactics? Unusual... and terrifying.
# reporter/mentionedcolin is injured
villainClever_outcome1_fail= I fumbled with it, panicked and sweating. Before I knew it they were on me. I'm not sure how [we] got out of there alive or found my way back, but I'd lost so much blood that I passed out when [we] reached the gates. When they found me, I was clutching that {1}.\n\n
They tell me none of these wounds are bites but... I'm going to quarantine myself just in case.\n\n
Those were definitely zombies.. I think. But zombies splitting up and taking shortcuts? Zombies using tactics? Unusual... and deadly.
# no item or injury
villainClever_outcome2= Screw items, how about getting out of here alive instead?\n\n
I made a heroic leap from the top of a car to a fire escape, then climbed up to the roof of the building. From there I could see our fort and tell which way to go, though I was only a few steps ahead of those monsters all the way back.\n\n
They're definitely zombies.. I think. But zombies splitting up and taking short cuts? Zombies using tactics? Unusual... and terrifying.

goalVillainInvestigate_pictureColin= false
goalVillainInvestigate= Something is up with the zed in [CityName]. They're... smarter. Some of them anyway. Using tools and tactics beyond "hey there's some brains in that skull over there - let's eat 'em!". Is it some different strain of the disease? Or have they been learning somehow? This could be very important.\n\n
We should ask around, explore the city and keep an eye out for clues.

# 3. Optional, run if player visits Rotten prior to 5: Meet with Jesse who's a little cautious about letting anyone in the city. Gets defensive if you suggest anything.

villainRotten_title= Reclusive Neighbors
villainRotten_picture= [FactionBackground]
villainRotten_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
villainRotten= I'm still not sure what to make of the Rotten. They have all the traits of a zombie: the unnatural strength, the virtual immortality, the horrible skin care regimen. The difference is, the Rotten are more likely to invite you in to tea than pluck your eyes from your skull. Well, mostly.\n\n
Their leader, Jesse, met us outside the Rotten's encampment, looking as grizzled as ever and chewing on some tobacco with his few remaining teeth. We exchanged the standard noncommittal nods and grunts of greeting.
villainRotten_option1= Ask about the smart zombies
villainRotten_outcome1= "They ain't ours, if that's what you're asking." Jesse spit a gob of tar. "No offence, but the tendency is for you folks to shoot first then sort out if they were Rotten or zombie after."\n\n
"Naw, they're some new kind of dead. It's like somebody's been training them to use tools and such. They're smarter than a pile of dung, sure, but colder than a rattlesnake at midnight. They rode too far into the desert, if you catch my drift."\n\n
As usual Jesse's cowboy idioms lost me, but I think I get the idea.

# 4. A few days after 2, event occurs: A Gustav stops by to say he's leaving the area (doesn't show up again until quest is resolved?), mentions more crafty Zed in this city is the reason. Suggests avoiding northern part of city.

villainGustav_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
villainGustav= Gustav stopped by briefly today. He didn't even try to sell us anything; just said he was leaving [CityName] for awhile and we should do the same.\n\n
_"Zee new ones is bad bad mertsi. Smart like a monkey, zey steal from Gustav."_\n\n
I guess he'd noticed the new breed of zed here who can use tools and open doors and stuff. Wherever they're coming from, they certainly are bad _"mertsi"_, whatever that means.
# one or the other not both
villainGustav_option1= What did they steal?
villainGustav_option2= What does mertsi mean?
villainGustav_outcome1= _"My beautiful Rebecca,"_ he said sorrowfully. _"Nineteen and Fifty Eight."_ He was practically choking on the words. _"Sixty... Sixty Special."_\n\n
"Oh you mean a CAR!" I laughed. I didn't mean to cheapen the loss... but I couldn't see how a zombie would steal a Cadillac. At any rate he claims they did, and that they ate the guy who was washing it, too.
villainGustav_outcome2= _"Deadmen,"_ he said. _"Zombie. Walker. Greenskin."_\n\n
_"If you see zis new type, should be stayink away. Much more danger, and someone controllink zem."_\n\n
Remote-controlled zombie thieves? I'm not sure what he was talking about, but Gustav is usually right about these things.

# 5. spy on clark

villainSighting_title= Mindless Workers
villainSighting_picture= parking
villainSighting_pictureColin= clark
villainSighting= Um, so, something weird is going on with these zombies. I was coming back from [missioning] and spotted five of them clustered around a Cadillac convertible. They seemed to be loading boxes into the trunk.\n\n
I know... impossible. But the weird thing is their leader. He looks like one of the Rotten: infected, but still human. He's shouting orders at them and waving his hands a lot. And he's wearing a McNoodles manager's outfit. Even a Rotten wouldn't be caught dead in one of those (pun intended!)
villainSighting_option1= Get closer
villainSighting_option2= Watch from a distance
villainSighting_outcome1= Yup, definitely zombies, no doubt about that. I made too much noise as I snuck up to them, and they sprang at me like any natural zed, all clawed hands and bitey mouths and terror-inducing roars. The difference was, one of them was holding a tire iron, mechanically moving its arm up and down as it ran at me. And they spread out like they were trying to surround me.\n\n
Unfortunately I couldn't learn any more as I was too busy running for my life.
villainSighting_outcome2= This McNoodles guy sure was weird. He seemed to be frustrated with the zombies, and kept hitting them with a clipboard he was carrying. One of them was fumbling with the passenger door until he came over and showed it how to use the latch. He made it practice that a few times, then hit it on the back of the head for good measure.\n\n
Eventually they drove off to somewhere. We should investigate, but I'm not sure where. The Rotten? A McNoodles?

villainMart= Remember that McNoodles manager who was ordering those zombies around? We found him! Well not him exactly, but a picture of him here in a McNoodles.\n\n
His name is Kevin Clark and he was "manager of the month" for 24 months running... but oddly all the portraits have been defaced. Some have the eyes poked out; some have mustaches and penises drawn over them. One has the words "Loser of the month" scribbled on it, and another just: "jerkface".\n\n
I guess his employees didn't like this Clark guy much?

villainRottenClark_picture= [FactionBackground]
villainRottenClark_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
villainRottenClark= Jesse frowned as deep as his withered features could muster when I asked him if he knew any McNoodles managers. He chewed thoughtfully.\n\n
"Could be," he said. "Used to be a young man by the name of Kevin Clark who sported such duds. Like the rest of us Rotten, he didn't he lose his mental-type faculties when he was bit. Least I assume he was just as much of a saddle-sore before as he was after."
# allow asking both of these
villainRottenClark_option1= You didn't like him?
villainRottenClark_option2= What happened to him?
villainRottenClark_outcome1= "Now that'd be an understatement." Jesse spit so hard that one of his molars came out. He picked it up, eyed it, then jammed it back in his mouth.\n\n
"Kevin was like a cattle dog, always herding people, biting at their heels. He didn't make any friends here, not that he tried. About as popular as a skunk at a parlor social, that one. He was more interested in the zombies, anyway. Nobody cared when he left."
villainRottenClark_outcome2= "He started spending more and more time with the zombies." said Jesse. "You know, those deaders don't seem to mind us Rotten. Green skin doesn't taste so good, I guess. Around us they're real peaceful, like cows at pasture."\n\n
"Anyhow the company suited him better, probably cause they couldn't talk back. We reckoned Clark went to live with them after he left us."

villainThirdTry= I was trying to jimmy open the rusted trunk of a car when I caught the depressingly familiar smell of decaying flesh on the wind. Not wanting to stick around, I tried sprinting back to base, but every route I took was blocked by the undead.\n\n
Before long I found myself cornered in the ball pit of an old McNoodles as the dead clawed at the torn netting surrounding the structure. Then, as one, they hesitated and the one closest to the door tentatively reached for the handle.
villainThirdTry_option1= Politely call out to Kevin Clark
villainThirdTry_option2= Demand Kevin Clark show himself
villainThirdTry_outcome1_pictureColin= clark
villainThirdTry_outcome1= A young green-skinned man in a McNoodles uniform strolled through the door, a cigarette in his hand. An aged zombie shuffled in after him wearing a very well tailored tuxedo.\n\n
"Well, well, well" said Clark. "My reputation precedes me."\n\n
I explained that we'd talked to his former friends and he sneered. "Friends? The people who snubbed me? And after all I did for them? Pah! Jenkins! Ash tray!"\n\n
With this command the tuxedoed zombie opened it's mouth as he knocked the ash from his cigar into it.

villainThirdTry_outcome2= "Who the hell do you think you are, shouting out orders for Mr. Clark, master of the undead!" cried a green-skinned man in a McNoodles uniform. He was flanked by an elderly zombie in an old tuxedo who seemed to be his servant.\n\n
As Clark strode to the ball pit, the zed who'd been chasing me rushed to part in front him, tripping over one another as they did so. Before he made it to me half the group was writhing on the ground.\n\n
"Incompetance!" Clark yelled, kicking one.
villainThirdTry_outcome2_option1= Continue...
villainThirdTry_end= He got down to business. "I am the president and founder of the Undead Republic of Clarkania. We just opened a franchise here in [CityName], henceforth known as Clarkston."\n\n
"Since you're now trespassing on my private property, which includes the entire city bounds, I demand that your faction leave immediately. I have tasked super squads of my employees to ensure that you vacate in a timely and efficient manner."\n\n
Despite the goofy outfit and silly "mua-ha-ha" laughter, he sounded like he meant it.

[Name] followed them once [he]'d given them the slip then doubled back. They led [him] to a city hall which seems to be the center of Clark's "Undead Republic".\n\n
We should send someone... but should it be a diplomatic envoy, or a detachment of soldiers?

villainHall= Their city hall was once a McNoodles; clumsily painted white, topped with randomly askew flags and surrounded by a high chainlink fence. The zed patrolling inside are equipped with assault rifles... which would be scarier if it looked like they knew how to shoot them. Most are holding the guns upside-down or waving them around like clubs.\n\n
Still, there are a _lot_ of zombies in there, and once they get a whiff of us they'll probably charge like any others, despite Mr. Clark's attempts to train them.\n\n
How do [we] handle this?
# roll leadership 10
villainHall_option1= Call for Mr. Clark (leadership)
# roll defense 15
villainHall_option2= Fight our way through (defense)
villainHall_outcome1_success= [We] yelled for Mr. Clark to come out, promising a business deal with amiable terms.\n\n
The guards scrambled over to the fence, clawing and bashing at it with their guns, but we held our ground on the other side.\n\n
After a few minutes, Clark's zombie butler toddled out of the main doors into the fray. He stuck his hand through the fence and dropped something onto the ground - a key to the service entrance on the other side of the building.
villainHall_outcome1_success_option1= Continue...
villainHall_outcome1_fail= [We] yelled up to Mr. Clark, demanding he come out and talk to us.\n\n
The zombies ran over to try to reach us through the fence, dropping their guns and reverting to clawing and biting. The fence held.\n\n
Our demands turned to threats, then pleading, but there was no response from their leader. Eventually [we] had to give up and leave. We should come back with more diplomatic leaders, or try another tactic.
villainHall_outcome2_success_picture= zombiesSuper
villainHall_outcome2_success_pictureColin= false
villainHall_outcome2_success= [We] shouted to attract the guards, and predictably they ran over to the fence to lunge at us, making easy pickings at close range. One found its gun's trigger and sprayed the courtyard with bullets before it shot itself in the head.\n\n
Inside the building was a bigger challenge, fighting in close quarters. These zed held mallets and axes - sometimes duct-taped to their hands - and were much better with them than guns.\n\n
Eventually [we] stood, bloodstained and exhausted, at the doors to the mayor's office.
villainHall_outcome2_success_option1= Continue...

But their guns did make very effective clubs, and [we] [were] beaten black and blue by the zombie mob. [FormalName's] arm is near useless.\n\n
[We] eventually finished them off, but there are more inside and [we're] already exhausted. Should [we] continue?
# disable option to keep going if [FormalName] was the only colin
villainHall_outcome2_fail_option1= Press on
villainHall_outcome2_fail_option2= Go home
# roll defense 15 again
villainHall_outcome2_fail_outcome1_success= [We] stormed through the front doors, rallying. The zombies within seemed to be ones Mr. Clark was training for domestic duties, and brandished feather dusters and brooms as well as axes and clubs.\n\n
[Name] fought heroically, though it will be some time before [he] can use that arm again.

villainHall_outcome2_fail_outcome1_fail= [Name] fought like a demon with that broken arm of [his], screaming each time [he] used it and pressing on nonetheless.\n\n
But these zed were smarter than average, and we were caught off guard by their unpredictable tactics. One pulled a painting off the wall and hurled it at [Name] with incredible strength. While [he] dodged it, another grabbed [his] legs and pulled [him] down.\n\n
As they tore [him] limb from limb, I ran.
villainHall_outcome2_fail_outcome2= We should either send a stronger attack force next time, or try another tactic.

When he noticed [us], Clark sighed. "Oh for pity's sake," he said, "Not you again. Why haven't you left town, or died yet?"
# both of these go to the same outcome
villainRant_option1= Say his franchise is illegal
villainRant_option2= Threaten to kill him
villainRantOutcome= Clark interrupted before I could speak:\n\n
"You humans are all the same. When I became infected, I had to hide in a graveyard for weeks 'cause you lot would kill anything that couldn't keep its skin on. I'd yell 'hey, still sentient over here' but you'd shoot anyway."\n\n
"This is exactly the kind of thing that used to happen at the McNoodles. Nobody listened! The other employees were useless insubordinates, and the customers... such entitled brats!"\n\n
"Blah blah blah extra soy sauce blah blah my noodles are too cold."
villainRantOutcome_option1= Listen to his ranting...
villainRantOutcome_outcome1= "They're _supposed_ to be cold you nincompoops, it's Zaru Soba! And if the counter staff weren't too busy gazing at their navels in a drug-induced haze they'd have told you that! Not to mention those clueless stoners never remembered to refill the sauce packet dispenser..."\n\n
[We] let the strange man build himself into a frenzy over the management of a long-gone fast food restaurant, until he finally brought the rant back around to our presence here in "Clarkston".\n\n
"And now here's _you_," he said, "invading my headquarters. Refusing to die."
# both lead to the same outcome again
villainRantOutcome_outcome1_option1= Tell him you'd happily leave if...
villainRantOutcome_outcome1_option2= Ask him if you can work out...
villainRantOutcomeTwo= "Tut tut TUT!" He yelled, startling Jenkins who dropped his hat and fell over trying to catch it. "I've had _enough_ of trying to be civilized. Jenkins, kill them!"\n\n
Jenkins just blinked at us and dripped spittle onto his waistcoat. This was the last straw for Mr. Clark. He tore at his hair, screaming "Fools! Incompetents! This is the last time I'll be embarrassed on my own property!"\n\n
Then he turned and leapt out the window.
villainRantOutcomeTwo_option1= That was weird...
villainRantOutcomeTwo_outcome1= As he hobbled to his Cadillac on a dislocated ankle, Clark yelled up at us:\n\n
"Hah! The city hall was only our customer service department! You'll never find our secret headquarters!"\n\n
We are clearly dealing with a madman here. Or a mad-Rotten or whatever he is. The attacks from his "super employees" won't stop until we find this secret headquarters somehow. In the meantime, I guess this city hall is ours.

[FormalName] spotted a group while [he] was out [missioning], and was quick-thinking enough to sneak after them and see where they went.\n\n
They led [him] to one of the town's overrun graveyards. The place is absolutely packed with zed - might be the place we're looking for.

Places like this - packed to the brim with dead even before they started walking - always made me wonder at the sense of keeping our loved ones around in physical form. Where's the comfort in knowing they're down there getting eaten by worms while we're up here living?\n\n
Well many of them aren't down there any more; they clawed their way out of the ground to join Clark's army of "employees". This is going to be quite a fight.

villainLastStand_success= After hours of fighting, Clark herded the remaining zombies into a solid stone mausoleum. We were forced to tackle it head on and force our way in. It felt ironic, the zombies holed up inside and us trying to take down their fort.\n\n
We used techniques we learned from them: attack from all sides at once, never give them a chance to regroup.\n\n

Then Jesse from the Rotten appeared like a western hero, striding down the hill towards us. He kicked in the mausoleum's door and fired twenty or thirty pistol rounds into the masses within.\n\n
Finally Mr. Clark yelled from within "okay, okay you win already, I'm coming out!"
villainLastStand_successJesse_option1= Continue...
villainLastStand_success_outcome1= We waited for Clark to come out of the tomb, then suddenly heard the roar of a car engine. Clark burst out of the doors in his 1950's Cadillac, one hand on the wheel and the other giving us the finger.\n\n
Whatever he yelled was lost in the noise, but it sounded like "I'll get you next time you meddling kids!" Seriously?\n\n
Inside we found Jenkins the zombie butler, looking confused. He slowly raised an arm to offer me a clinking cup of tea.\n\n
I think we'll keep him.
# all failures lead here, [Name] dies, can try the mission again
villainLastStand_fail= We did our best but it wasn't enough. Though Clark's zombies often broke rank and couldn't hold their weapons properly, they were incredibly strong, and there were a lot more of them than us.\n\n
When [FormalName] went down, I sounded the retreat. Clark's zed didn't follow us far from their graveyard.\n\n
I'll miss [Name]. [He] was a good kid. Now we need to get this bastard Clark for [his] sake, if nothing else.

Of course, we'll have to reclaim that farm before we try anything. It'll be tough to taxi down a runway if zed keep getting caught in the propeller.

The thing's seen better days. The propeller's missing, it's out of fuel, and weighed down by crop-dusting equipment. Not to mention we'll need to find a pilot who can fly a prop plane.\n\n

[FactionLeader] said [factionHe]'d ask around, but they don't have any pilots. They did have an old bomber jacket... but just _looking_ like a pilot isn't enough.
# use this text for the 2nd failure if there are more than 2 map factions who we aren't at war with

Knowing how to fly a plane doesn't help slow your fall from 3-story drop. Especially if you're mobbed by an angry gaggle of geese at the time.

# 6. Faction X says they have a pilot, but they're not about to give up one of their people easily, but they know of a big cache of weapons that was to be distributed to the local police as part of the Government's 1033 Program (giving the police surplus military armaments) that had been waylaid by a corrupt officer.

Their scouts found a big cache of firepower nearby, but the area's too hot to safely get them. They want us to head over there and bring them back the weapons.\n\n

We could try shooting them from back here, but it'll rile them up something fierce. Maybe if got the warehouse's backup generator running we could fry all the zed in their own juices. Alternatively we could try to punch a hole in the basement wall from the outside and flush all the zed right out of here.

# requires level 2 scientist, always success

If we still want to recruit their pilot, we'll have to try something sneaky. Maybe if we slip back in at night we can convince the pilot to join up with us.

We'll need to find some other way to get a pilot. Maybe we could teach one of our own people to be a pilot if we had the right textbooks.

airplaneThreaten_3= I got to talking with [FormalName] at the campfire last night. [He] kept asking questions about that Beaver we've been trying to get running. Mostly, who were we going to take with us when we fly out of here.\n\n
I told [him] we hadn't worked that out yet and [he] scowled at me: "Listen bud, you shouldn't wait on those kind of decisions. It worries people... and who knows what might happen if we start to think you're going to leave us behind."
airplaneThreaten_option1= Tell [him] to calm down
airplaneThreaten_option2= Agree to take [him]
airplaneThreaten_option3= Toss [him] in prison
# stuff gets stolen immediately
# {1} "15 food" or "30 medicine" use AttackManager.getRaidItem
airplaneThreaten_outcome1= "Calm down?!" [he] spluttered. "You're flying out of here and leaving us to fend for ourselves, and you want me to calm down?! Screw you and the horse you rode in on!"\n\n
Later we discovered our storehouse had been ransacked and [a] {1} stolen. We searched [Name's] room but found nothing. With no proof I can't very well punish the [guy]. I mean, it _might_ have been someone from the outside with very coincidental timing.
# colin marked as coming on the plane
airplaneThreaten_outcome2= [Name] took my hand in [his] and gave me a grim smile. "Good to know where we stand."\n\n
Well, I guess that's one less seat on the plane out of six total. I hope no one is planning on bringing any serious luggage.
# recovery mission (vacation) for 3 days, -20 happiness
airplaneThreaten_outcome3_picture= jail
airplaneThreaten_outcome3_pictureColin= true
airplaneThreaten_outcome3= From the expression on [Name's] face, I'm guessing [he] wasn't expecting that response. But [he] threatened to commit a crime, and I can't take stuff like that lightly. If we aren't all working together, there's no hope for any of us.

# 19. Survivor Flight Request: Offers to give something they've been holding back if they get to come along. Can agree, tell them no, or take their stuff. If you agree lowers the number of spots on the plane by one but gets an item reward.  If you tell them no, they lose happiness. If you take their stuff, they leave the fort in a huff.
# [Name] = Person begging to be let on
# {1} = Item to trade for spot
airplaneOffer_title= Rich Passenger
airplaneOffer_picture= airplane
airplaneOffer_pictureColin= true
airplaneOffer_1= [FormalName] just swung by to show me the sweet {1} [he] found. [He] said I could have it if I'm willing to bring [him] along with us when we fly out of here.\n\n
I'm not too sure about auctioning off a plane seat like that, but it sure is a nice {1}. Hell, I've wanted one of those since I was a little kid.
airplaneOffer_2= Seems [FormalName] has been holding back on us. I just learned [he]'s gotten a hold of a {1} and is offering it to anyone who will guarantee [him] a spot on our plane when it flies out of here.\n\n
Not sure why [he] didn't come directly to me in the first place, since I'm the one deciding this.
airplaneOffer_3= [FormalName] approached me today to ask about the plane we're fixing up. There are limited seats, so [he] wanted to know if [he] can come along with us.\n\n
[He] said [he] was even willing to let me have the {1} [his] grandma had left [him]. [He]'s been keeping it safe in memory of her, but [he] knows if she was still around, she'd whip [his] butt if she thought her {1} had a chance to save [him] and [he] didn't use it.
airplaneOffer_option1= Decline the offer
airplaneOffer_option2= Agree to the offer
airplaneOffer_option3= Confiscate the {1}
airplaneOffer_outcome1= As much as I would have liked to get my hands on [his] stuff, I had to tell [him] we couldn't guarantee [him] a spot on the plane. Hell, things are going to be so tight in there, I'm not even sure the {1} would fit if we wanted to take it with us.
airplaneOffer_outcome2= I agreed to take [Name] along with us. [He]'s a good [man], and getting the use of [his] {1} is a welcome bonus. I just hope we've got space to take it with us after the six of us are all packed in there.
# colin dies (left fort after item confiscated), and you get item
airplaneOffer_outcome3_picture= alone
airplaneOffer_outcome3_pictureColin= false
airplaneOffer_outcome3= I took the {1} from [him] and told [him] it was for the good of the fort and if [he] didn't like it, [he] was welcome to find out what it was like trying to survive on the other side of the wall.\n\n
Turns out [he] took me up on that. When we got up the next morning [his] room was cleared out and there was no sign of [him] anywhere.\n\n
So, one new toy and one less mouth to feed. I just hope we don't need that extra pair of hands the next time the zed attack.

# 20. Survivor Flight Request: Pleads to come along (Have a couple of different variants?). Can agree or tell them no. If you agree lowers the number of spots on the plane by one. If you tell them no, they lose happiness.
# [Name] = Person pleading
airplanePlead_title= Sad Passenger
airplanePlead_picture= airplane
airplanePlead_pictureColin= true
airplanePlead_1= I spent some time trying to cheer up [FormalName] last night. I knew [he]'d been down in the dumps and I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to help.\n\n
Seems [he]'s really worried about being left behind if we get that plane of ours working. [He] knows we're going to take the more useful people and [he]'s afraid [he] isn't going to measure up. I'm not sure what to tell [him].
airplanePlead_2= [FormalName] came up to me in tears today. [He] told me [he] couldn't stand life here in [CityName] anymore. Fighting the zed daily, living on canned tuna and the few sprouts we've managed to coax out of the dry ground.\n\n
[He] wants out of here and [he] knows I do too. That I'll be flying into the bright blue yonder the instant we get that Beaver running. [He] wants a spot on that plane. [He] _needs_ a spot on that plane.\n\n
[He]'s sure passionate about it, at least. What should I tell him?
airplanePlead_3= [FormalName] is out there again, watching the airplane at the old farm again. [He] spends all [his] time out there picking weeds and counting the clouds.\n\n
When I asked [him] what [he] was doing, [he] gave me a quiet smile and said: "Don't you see? The plane's all that keeping me going. It's the only chance I have of getting out of this place alive."\n\n
Then a look of desperation came over him. "I am coming along, right skipper? You won't leave me behind, will you?"
airplanePlead_option1= Bring [him] with us
airplanePlead_option2= Say I can't guarantee it
airplanePlead_outcome1= How could I say no to those puppy-dog eyes? I agreed to take [him] and mentally crossed one more of our six plane seats off. It's going to get pretty cramped in there, but we've got to take as many people as we can.
# -40 happiness
airplanePlead_outcome2= I tried to let [him] down as gently as I could, but I could tell [he] wasn't buying my line about there being more food and room once we're gone. [He] was obviously quite crestfallen.

Do we want to fly out of here?
airplaneTakeOff_noPilot= Oops! We forgot to bring a pilot. Who did we think was going to fly the plane? I added [Name] to our passenger list. Now we have:\n\n
Do we want to fly out of here?
airplaneTakeOff_noPassenger= Oops, almost forgot to bring [Name2] along like I promised earlier. [He2] wasn't going to let us forget though; [he2] was already sitting in [his2] seat with [his2] suitcase in [his2] lap when we boarded. Now the passenger list is:\n\n
Do we want to fly out of here?
airplaneTakeOff_noPilotPassenger= Oops! We forgot to bring a pilot. Better make sure [Name] comes along or we won't get off the ground. And we alomst forgot to bring [Name2] along like I promised, but [he2] was already sitting in [his2] seat with [his2] suitcase in [his2] lap when we boarded. Now the passenger list is:\n\n
Do we want to fly out of here?
airplaneTakeOff_noLeader= Hey, don't leave without me! Now that I'm coming, our passenger list is:\n\n
Do we want to fly out of here?
airplaneTakeOff_option1= Leave [CityName]
airplaneTakeOff_option2= Wait, no, I forgot something!
airplaneTakeOff_outcome1= As the plane flew over [CityName], I have to admit there was a lump in my throat. Could we have done better here? Was there still more to be done? I guess we'll never know.\n\n
On the other hand, we're still alive. And sometimes, that's all you can ask for.
airplaneTakeOff_outcome2= We decided no to board the plane just yet. There's still more to do here in [CityName]... but it's nice to know we've got a way out if the going gets too rough.
airplaneTakeOff_outcome1_option1= Continue...

# Teh Interwebs
# The 1337 crew believe the government have a secret information network and they want access
#
# Overview:
#interwebs (leetcrew & government)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. meet with government
# they talk about orders from headquarters back east over "The network" that give them authority to conscript us. agree or disagree, it doesn't matter. their scouts radioed them info about an office tower which needs to be scavenged. potential dangerous quest there. "radioed, networks, man these guys are connected."
interwebsIntro_title= Conscription
interwebsIntro_picture= [FactionBackground]
interwebsIntro_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
interwebsIntro= Senator Davis had a special request for us during our meeting. Well, "request" isn't quite the right word. She says she now has authority from head office to conscript any local citizens to serve the Government. This just came over on "the network" from the federal government back east. She said we could take it up with them if we have a problem with it.\n\n
These guys have power and the Internet? Wow they really are connected.
interwebsIntro_option1= Agree to help
interwebsIntro_option2= Refuse to do it
interwebsIntro_option3= Ask how we contact the feds
# +5 respect
interwebsIntro_outcome1= Davis nodded. "Thank you for your loyal service, citizens."\n\n
She said their scouts had radioed in that an office tower in the financial district is ready to be scavenged. We should find at least three truckloads of supplies there that the government needs. Our mission is send our best scavengers, retrieve the supplies and bring them back here.
interwebsIntro_outcome2= Davis frowned. "Did I say you had a choice?"\n\n
She said their scouts had radioed in that an office tower in the financial district is ready to be scavenged. We should find at least three truckloads of supplies there that the government needs. Our mission is send our best scavengers, retrieve the supplies and bring them back here.
# optional, show option 1 and 2 again if this is picked first
interwebsIntro_outcome3= She was clearly ready for this one. "Access to secure communication channels with federal offices is restricted," she said. "and use of the network is for authorized personnel only... I'm afraid your security clearance level is too low to allow it."

# 2. quest turns out to have nothing.
# we bust in and exhaustively climb stairs all day, searching every floor for whatever the govt wanted you to find here but finding nothing. no scavengable goods whatsoever. not even coffee in the break room. at the very top of Incredicorp in the president's giant office we find a computer printed note: "LOLZ got here first! Signed Cryptico". option: return to govt. Davis thanks you +respect but doesn't know what it means. they think LOLZ is some acronym for a terrorist organization and says she'll have to report this to head office.
# +5 respect to government
interwebsTower_title= Incredicorp Industries
interwebsTower_picture= street
interwebsTower_pictureColin= false
interwebsTower= [We] spent hours combing through the office tower the Government assigned us to scavenge, climbing stairs until my legs were ready to collapse. But [we] found nothing useful whatsoever, not even coffee in the break rooms.\n\n
It was clear by the 5th floor that someone had beaten us to this place, but [we] persisted to the top. In the CEO's office, alone on the massive oak desk, [we] found a note:\n\n
"Lulz, beat you to it! - Cryptico"
interwebsTower_option1= Return to the government
interwebsTower_outcome1_picture= [FactionBackground]
interwebsTower_outcome1_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
interwebsTower_outcome1= Senator Davis read the note and mulled it over. "How could they have known... " she wondered. "The scouts only radioed in the location a few days before..."\n\n
"Well, it looks like like 'Cryptico' might be a possible threat. Might be an individual, or some sort of terrorist organization with an agenda to undermine the Government. Keep an eye out for them."\n\n
"Oh, and good work [p|citizen|citizens]. I will let you know when we have your next assignment."

# 3. a week later you get find another note slipped under the door from cryptico calling you government lackeys and saying they know something you'll want to know too. come meet cryptico at the leetcrew. bring a present.
interwebsLetter_title= Cryptico
interwebsLetter_picture= gate2
interwebsLetter_pictureColin= false
interwebsLetter= We found a letter slipped through our gates this morning, in the same printed typeface as the one from the office tower. It read:\n\n
"Hail, Government lackeys. I know you work for them. And I know other things. And those things, you want to know them too. If you've got the cojones to meet, find me at the 1337cREw compound. Come in the PM; I'm not a morning person. And bring prezzies. - Cryptico"\n\n
Wonder what Cryptico means by "prezzies". Flowers and chocolate?

# 4. meet with leet crew to trigger this step.
# dara says cryptico is way hidey and did you bring a present. "present" can be any item that improves engineering, or 10 fuel. need to come back if you don't have it.
\t# after paying, dara reveals that she is cryptico, which duh you should have known because everybody calls her that. she says they've been listening to government channels and decoding their scout broadcasts. just for the lulz. can comment that's immortal or smart of them for +respect, then she says hey listen you want to be useful, help us get online with the government internet. they talk to hq with that thing, it's the internet! have all this info we don't. we want on it. find a way in. send an engineer to meet with them.
# we used to have this thing called net neutrality, then we lost it. this time we're gonna fight; right to communications is a basic human right, government has to share it with their citizens, if that's what we are to them.
# {1} some random equipment we have that improves engineering
# {2} some other random equipment we have that improves engineering
interwebsLeetcrew_title= Cryptico Revealed
interwebsLeetcrew_picture= [FactionBackground]
interwebsLeetcrew_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
interwebsLeetcrew= [We] told Dara [we] were here to meet with Cryptico. She put her hands on her hips and said "Okay, did you bring a present?"
# hide these two if we don't have 2 or even 1 suitable equipment
interwebsLeetcrew_option1= Offer {1}
interwebsLeetcrew_option2= Offer {2}
# always visible but might be greyed out
interwebsLeetcrew_option3= Offer 10 fuel
interwebsLeetcrew_option4= Come back later
# all three gifts lead here
interwebsLeetcrewGift= Dara accepted the gift. "Okay, so, I'm Cryptico, " she said. "Like that wasn't super obvious, right? It's my handle, it's what the Crew call me."\n\n
"So, we've decoded the Government radio channels and we've been listening in. That's how we knew about the office tower, and about you, and one more thing."\n\n
"The Government have this thing called the network. It's the Internet, right? Invented in the 80s so they'd have a way to talk to the feds if something crazy happened. You know, crazy like the zombpocalypse, right?"
interwebsLeetcrewGift_option1= Uh, right...
interwebsLeetcrewGift_outcome1= "So, we want back online! Communication is a basic human right, okay? We had this thing called net neutrality once but we lost it because we didn't fight for it. Now the Government has access to the network and we plebs don't. We don't even know what's going on in the east. That's not ethical! It's not right! Right?"\n\n
I nodded, though I wasn't sure. She continued. "Okay, so we know they like you. So poke around, try to learn about their system. Send an engineer next time you meet with them. At least find out what Operating System they use."
interwebsLeetcrew_outcome4= What would someone named Cryptico like? A book about ciphers? A secret decryptor ring? Or is it "crypt" as in graveyards and stuff?

# 5. meet with government to trigger this.
# can either ask Davis about the internet, or snoop around for someone else.
\t# asking Davis is a dead end, she says "the internet isn't some series of tubes there for your amusement." it's for top secret government use only, and if people were clogging it up with their playing games and watching youtubes then important government emails wouldn't get through.
\t#you lurk around and find Andy in his office playing windows solitaire. pink hair makes him seem approachable. try to impress him with engineer speak - two options.  like talk about video games (easier - turns out he wishes he was a game designer instead of an it monkey), vs discussing linux (harder but gives +5 respect if success). both roll engineering skill and if you fail you try again next meeting. if success, he tells you he can't get online because they've blocked every damn website. It started with just facebook...
\t# The government slowly locked down all the offensive and time wasting sites on the corporate firewall: first facebook, then twitter. All the porn disappeared shortly afterwards, and after a few years the only pages visible without a big netnanny notice was the gov'ts own intranet. Andy just keeps the machines running, but the only one he knows of who has auth to get online is Davis's computer in her office. She doesn't let anyone in there. tells you to get lost he doesn't want to lose his job and pension. Maybe dara will have a plan?
interwebsAndy_title= Search for the Network
interwebsAndy_picture= [FactionBackground]
interwebsAndy_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
interwebsAndy= Senator Davis was giving orders to a group of soldiers when [we] arrived. They didn't seem happy about "graveyard duty", whatever that was, but she said she was following orders from her commanders in the federal government.\n\n
"We all have tough jobs to do, " she said, "now go do yours."
interwebsAndy_option1= Ask Davis about the network
interwebsAndy_option2= Snoop around the Government base
# optional dead end, allow picking option2 after this one but not other way around
interwebsAndy_outcome1= "Absolutely not, " she said, crossing her arms. "The network is not some series of tubes there for your amusement. It is for top secret government use only. If people started clogging it up by playing shooter games and watching Youtubes, important government emails might not get through. For the sake of national security, we can't have that."\n\n
The senator seems to be a dead end. Maybe someone else can help us?
interwebsAndy_outcome1_option1= Snoop around the Government base
# both snoops lead here
interwebsAndy_outcome2_pictureColin= moore
interwebsAndy_outcome2= [We] poked [our] [p|head|heads] into a few rooms. Soldiers: nope. More soldiers: nope. Politicians in heated argument: nope. Then off in a disused wing, we found a man hunched over a computer. He has shockingly pink hair, and seemed to be playing Minesweeper. Could be our ticket to network access. I stepped in and introduced myself.\n\n
"Oh. Hi." he said, quickly switching to a spreadsheet app, "My name's Andy. I'm the fort's IT guy. Uh... you probably shouldn't be in here."
# replace above if we're back again
interwebsAndy_outcome2Again= [We] returned to the disused wing with the pink-haired IT guy, Andy. This time he was definitely playing Minesweeper when [we] came in. He turned his monitor off.\n\n
"Oh, hi again."
interwebsAndy_outcome2_option1= Talk about Video Games (engineering)
interwebsAndy_outcome2_option2= Talk about Linux (engineering)
# video games is an easier roll than Linux? they're the same?
interwebsAndy_outcome2_outcome1_success= "World of Goo, Fez, Rockets Rockets Rockets" Andy reminisced, "It was all about the indie games. I used to wish I made games, instead of sitting at this desk plunking away at a terrible Windows server architecture and waiting for my pension."\n\n
"The network? Nah, not from this computer. They blocked it long before the outbreak: first Facebook, then game and news sites; soon the Internet was nothing but Net Nanny notices. The only machine that still has uncensored access is Senator Davis' private computer."\n\n
Well, at least we found out the Operating System.
# come back and try again
interwebsAndy_outcome2_outcome1_fail= Andy was unimpressed. "Angry Birds? Candy Crush? Is that what you call gaming? I'm sorry buddy, we have nothing to talk about."\n\n
Maybe we should come back later with someone who knows their geek culture a little better.
interwebsAndy_outcome2_outcome2_success= "I liked Slackware too, " said Andy. "Or Mint for gaming. But we're all 'Microsoft Windows Enterprise Solutions' here at the government." he smacked his monitor.\n\n
"The network? Nah, not from this computer. They blocked it long before the outbreak: first Facebook, then game and news sites; soon the Internet was nothing but Net Nanny notices. The only machine that still has uncensored access is Senator Davis' private computer. But she'd never let you in there, sorry."\n\n
Well, at least we found out the Operating System.
# come back and try again
interwebsAndy_outcome2_outcome2_fail= "Listen, " Andy said, "you can pronounce it linn-ix or lie-nucks, but not whatever you just said. Do you even know what an operating system is?"\n\n
Maybe we should come back later with someone who knows their geek culture a little better.

# 6. meet with Dara to tell her we failed.
# she says no this is great, we have a contact on the inside now. think he likes video games? here's the plan: we make a game that needs to be always online, so only Davis's computer can run it. (but the servers? tut tut) it contains malware that will snoop around and find that internet connection for us so we can connect ourselves. Alien Black Hole, a maze game. Need to send someone convincing to talk to Andy.
interwebsMalware_title= Empty Handed
interwebsMalware_picture= [FactionBackground]
interwebsMalware_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
interwebsMalware= I gave Dara the bad news: only one computer at the Government can reach the network, and we can't get to it.\n\n
"Wait, " she was hopeful, "you said the pink-haired dude has access, right? He doesn't need to get _us_ in, just _this_." She pulled out a USB stick. "If he plugs it in, it'll snoop around and download the deets to that secure connection."\n\n
"He likes games, right? Let's put one on this and tell him it'll only run on the Senator's machine. He plugs it in to play, and boom goes the dynamite. Boom! So, which of these games do we use?"
interwebsMalware_option1= Alien Black Hole
interwebsMalware_option2= Sburb People Simulator
interwebsMalware_option3= Rebuild VII
# all options lead here
interwebsMalwareOtucome= Dara loaded the game up onto the USB drive. "Yeah, this game was still in beta when the world went to hell, but I was a playtester. The whole world was dying for it to come out. Haha, right? Anyway I bet he never got to play it."\n\n
"Tell him this game needs to be always online cuz of DRM, so it needs a connection to the network. Make him believe, okay? We need this."\n\n
She handed me the drive. "May the force be with you, [brother]."

# 7. meet with govt. deliver usb key to Andy. he's bored to tears. need to convince him either that he should quit & become a game developer with the leet crew (leadership roll - tell him the truth) or that this is the raddest game ever and possibly the last game ever written (engineering roll). Can try one roll then the other. Third option is to threaten him that you'll remind his bosses he exists - if you do this you can't get him at the end. Andy says come back in a week and he'll tell you what he thinks. Davis interrupts you & you jump. She's conscripting you to scavenge another building that her scouts heard of on the radio, this time a bunker under a suburban house.
# add mission to a suburban house
interwebsInstall_title= The Installation
interwebsInstall_picture= [FactionBackground]
interwebsInstall_pictureColin= moore
interwebsInstall= "What's this?" asked Andy when I dropped the USB stick in his hands. I told him it was only the hottest game the world's been anticipating since the dead started chomping.\n\n
"It's not a zombie game, is it?" He looked dubious. "I've had enough of those... and what do you mean it's always online, that doesn't make any sense... I mean their servers..."
interwebsInstallAgain= "Oh you're back." Andy was just staring at the wall when we met him this time. He looked dangerously, desperately bored. "Did you bring that game?"
interwebsInstall_option1= Convince him to join the 1337cREw (leadership)
interwebsInstall_option2= Convince him the game is great (engineering)
interwebsInstall_option3= Threaten his job security
interwebsInstall_outcome1_success= I told him the truth. There was malware on the USB drive, and the 1337cREw wanted to use it to get access to the Government's network. In exchange for helping us, I said, I'd put in the good word for him with the 1337cREw.\n\n
He perked up at this. "They'd let me do actual programming instead of sitting around doing nothing? Alright, screw my pension, let's do this."\n\n
"Come back in a week and I'll have your access data."
interwebsInstall_outcome1_success_option1= Continue...
interwebsInstall_outcome1_fail= "Uh, no, I've heard of those guys," said Andy. "Cyber-terrorists they say. Sounds like a hard life. Probably no benefits. I think you should take your game back and go."\n\n
Maybe we could send someone else to convince him.
interwebsInstall_outcome2_success= Andy was convinced. "Man, this game sounds amazing. It's too bad about the DRM, but as soon as Senator Davis goes home for the night I'm going to load it up on her machine. Don't worry, she'll never know."\n\n
"Come back next week and we can talk about the game!"
interwebsInstall_outcome2_success_option1= Continue...
interwebsInstall_outcome2_fail= I guess I failed to convince him. "Good games are about more than the graphics," he said. "They have to do something different, they have to pull you in and speak to you. You should take your game back and go... I'm really busy."\n\n
Clearly he isn't. We should send someone else to talk to him in a few days, maybe he'll change his mind.
# always succeeds but he won't join you later
interwebsInstall_outcome3= This scared him. "Don't tell my boss. If they find out I'm doing nothing in here all day, they'll put me on the wall. I'm a thinker, not a soldier. I'd die out there!"\n\n
I pressed him until he caved. "Okay, okay, I'll play your game on the Senator's computer. I'll... I'll tell you what I think of it next time we meet."
interwebsInstall_outcome3_option1= Continue...
# all 3 continues go here
interwebsInstallMission_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
interwebsInstallMission= I bumped into the Senator on the way out of Andy's office. I hope my fright wasn't too obvious.\n\n
"There you are, " she said. "We need your service to the Government again, [p|citizen|citizens]. Our scouts have located a supply cache hidden in a bunker in a suburban backyard. Its contents need to be salvaged and brought to us ASAP. Here's the briefing."\n\n
She didn't wait for my reply, just shoved a folder into my hand then turned on her heel and marched away.

# 9. mission like before
# leetecrew beat you there again and cleaned the place out. note from cryptico says hurry up and do that thing we talked about. you can scavenge anyway, and if you roll well you'll at least you find some medicine and food upstairs.

interwebsHouse= Looks like the 1337cREw beat us to the punch like last time. The backyard bunker was huge, easily a four-person deal. A legacy of the cold war, or some doomsday prepper who must have died before they could get to it. But empty. Just a note on the floor that said "Pwned again. - Cryptico"\n\n
I guess we could search the rest of the house. The Government didn't mention it.
interwebsHouse_option1= Check the house (scavenging)
interwebsHouse_option2= Leave
# roll scavenging skill to find +10 food and +5 medicine
interwebsHouse_outcome1_success= [We] found some food in the kitchen. Upstairs, the building's former owners were lying in bed together, dead of an overdose of sleeping pills. Two parents and two kids, lined up like dwarves in a fairy tale, the sheets pulled up to their chins.\n\n
We made sure they were dead just in case, then took what pills were left in the cabinets.
# injure mentionedcolin who is also reporter
interwebsHouse_outcome1_fail= [We] found the building's former owners lying in bed together, two parents and two kids with stained sheets pulled up to their chins. Looks like they'd taken pills rather than use that bunker outside.\n\n
As I was leaning over to read the label on the pill bottle, one of the children opened its eyes and snapped at me. It wormed its way out of the covers and lunged.\n\n
Startled and disturbed, [we] booked it out of there. No way [we're] going back. I need a couple days just to get my head straight after that experience.

#10. meet with government to report findings.

She narrowed her eyes at me when I didn't reply. "No, seriously. Where are my weapons?"
# available if you got interwebsHouse_outcome1_success
interwebsReport_option1= Deliver food and medicine we found
interwebsReport_option2= It was the 1337cREw
interwebsReport_option3= Say Nothing
# -10 food, -5 medicine
interwebsReport_outcome1= I promised her this was all we'd found.\n\n
"I suppose this will have to do, " she sighed. "Thank you for your report. The Government will take it from here."
interwebsReport_outcome1_option1= Continue...
interwebsReport_outcome2= "The who now?" She leaned in. "Are they protecting that Cryptico? Was there another note?"\n\n
I explained that the 1337cREw had been listening in to the radio reports from their scouts, and had cracked the code they use. I left out the part about the network and the USB drive.\n\n
The senator was creepily calm about it. She just thanked [us] for [our] report and dismissed [us].
interwebsReport_outcome2_option1= Continue...
interwebsReport_outcome3= I told her there was nothing there when we arrived and that was all I knew. I didn't mention the note from Cryptico this time.\n\n
The senator didn't believe me, but she let [us] go.\n\n
"We're keeping an eye on your group, citizen. If it turns out you've kept those weapons for your own use, you are going to seriously regret it."

interwebsHouseAndy_pictureColin= moore
interwebsHouseAndy= I snuck over to Andy's office after the meeting. Turns out he loved the game we gave them, and couldn't stop raving about it.\n\n
"It was totally worth the chance of getting caught on her computer," he said, returning the USB drive. "But don't worry, she doesn't suspect a thing."\n\n
The drive felt heavy in my hand with the important data it held. We should bring it back to the 1337cREw as soon as we can.
# replace above if you convinced Andy to join the leetcrew.
interwebsHouseAndyCrew= I snuck over to Andy's office after the meeting. He was giddy from his first stab at government espionage.\n\n
"Sup comrades! I totally hacked that data you wanted off the senator's computer. I plugged this baby in and just let her do the work." He handed back the USB stick. "It's all on there, what the 1337cREw need to know. So... you're going to tell them I want to join, right? I could be a great hacker, I think this is what I was born for."\n\n
I gave him the thumbs up.

# 11. meet with cryptico
# cryptico laughs, he really did it? okay let's see what's on this thing. what the heck, there's no network at all! no trace of any connection, not so much as an email sent in years. This means Davis is lying about everything. dammit. well, it was written to download any encrypted data, looks like something about the disease. your engineers can look it over if they want but she's bummed that there's no net connection. can ask about letting Andy be part of the leet crew but it takes convincing with leadership or you can bribe with power from our powerplant or with more fuel.

interwebsDisconnect= I watched eagerly as Dara parsed through the data we'd collected. She seemed to get more and more frustrated.\n\n
"There's nothing here!" she finally shouted. "No network at all! No trace of any connection. The senator hasn't even gotten an email in years... she's just been lying to everyone so they'll follow her orders."\n\n
She tossed me back the USB stick and pouted. "The last thing they sent her was an encrypted dump from some Euro agency. If you want it you can decrypt it yourself. I'm done with this."
interwebsDisconnect_option1= Ask if Andy can join them
interwebsDisconnect_option2= Done
interwebsDisconnect_outcome1= "Andy who?" Dara was skeptical. "That pink haired dude? Does he have the chops?"
interwebsDisconnect_outcome1_option1= You owe us (respect 75)
interwebsDisconnect_outcome1_option2= Convince them (leadership)
interwebsDisconnect_outcome1_outcome1= "Yeah, " she agreed, "I guess you guys have been solid, and Andy did put himself at risk for this even though it was a total shnozhonk. You tell him he's got a place in the Crew if he wants it."
# leadership roll
interwebsDisconnect_outcome1_outcome2_success= "Yeah, " she agreed, "I guess Andy did put himself at risk for this even though it was a total shnozhonk. You tell him he's got a place in the Crew if he wants it."
interwebsDisconnect_outcome1_outcome2_fail= "Bwah, no!" Dara rolled her eyes at me. "The last thing the Crew need is another script kiddie who thinks he's a hacker just because he plugged a drive in. We've got enough of those already."\n\n
I guess risking your life to help these guys isn't enough to get you into the 1337cREw. Sorry Andy.

# 12. analyze encrypted data mission in lab.
# looks like a bunch of stuff about the infection from the European Center for Disease Control. Early vectors, studies of its effect on the brain, and one study of chimpanzees and convalescent plasma serums from one monkey who seemed to have survive the disease. It was showing promise if they could just find a human survivor to try it with. But the data dump is headed with a letter addressed to the CDC saying they were overwhelmed and good luck.
# this potential mission sticks around until you do it, even after 13, 14, 15
interwebsAnalyze_title= Analysis Complete
interwebsAnalyze_picture= lab
interwebsAnalyze_pictureColin= false
interwebsAnalyze= Looks like the European Center for Disease Control sent the Government a big data dump before the lines went dead.\n\n
Basically all their research on the infection is here. Early vectors, studies of its effect on the brain. And one promising trial of convalescent plasma serum from the blood of a resistant chimpanzee. They claim it worked on other chimps, but not on people. They needed to find a resistant human for that.\n\n
We're going to hold on to this data. Could be the key to a vaccine someday.

# 13. return to govt, after 11 but possibly before 12
# Davis is super pissed off about a pink-haired techworker caught doing something wrong. she's in the middle of transferring him. you can confront her about there not being any network; she stammers then breaks down and admits it. you can either tell everyone, which destroys the government then and there with a military coup, or promise to stay quiet for +respect. you can turn in the leet crew and say they've been listening in on the radio for alliance. you can discuss andy, who they realize hasn't done any work in almost a decade. they can't fire because of the union, but they've given him a gun and transferred him to guard duty. if the leet crew accepted him, you can rescue him and he runs off. or if you turned the leetcrew in, you can ask to take him yourself. If not at least he'll still get his pension as a guard, he thinks.
# mad as hell and not going to take this anymore
interwebsEnd_title= The Network
interwebsEnd_picture= [FactionBackground]
interwebsEnd_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
interwebsEnd= I confronted Senator Davis, accusing her of lying about the network so she could make up orders from nonexistant bosses at the federal government.\n\n
She caved almost immediately, like she'd been expecting this. "Yes, " she admitted, "we are the only branch of the government that still exists, to my knowledge. Someone needed to make the hard decisions... and it was easier for people to believe that person was halfway across the continent."\n\n
"Listen, if people found out, there could be a coup. Please... these people need me. They need the lie."
interwebsEnd_option1= Tell everyone
interwebsEnd_option2= Keep her secret
# you decide to tell everyone, -50 respect, -50 strength
interwebsEnd_outcome1_pictureColin2= moore
interwebsEnd_outcome1= I stormed out of the office and right into Andy. I yelled "The network is a lie!" and he answered "I know! Well... I always suspected!".\n\n
We marched down to the cantina where soldiers were gathering for lunch break. "The network is a lie!" we yelled in unison.\n\n
We continued on this like this as people stopped and stared, whispering and looking nervously at one another. You could see them starting to take sides, those who'd back the senator and those who'd been looking for an excuse to remove her. We'll have to wait and see what happens in the coming days.
# only if they agreed to have him earlier
interwebsEnd_outcome1_option1= Ask Andy what he'll do now
interwebsEnd_outcome1_outcome1= He seemed optimistic that things would turn out well for the Government. "If she holds on to power, at least it will be honestly. But my money's on the other guy." He gestured at a man in a general's uniform.\n\n
"No offence, " he said, "but it's my best option. I mean, the way you operate... you guys don't seem much better than the old boss."\n\n
I guess I should be insulted? But we shook hands and I wished him well.
# replace above if leetcrew agreed to take him and still exists, +10 respect +5 strength for them
interwebsEnd_outcome1_outcome1_leetcrew= "Leet Crew Eff-tee-double-yew!" he pronounced it without a trace of irony. "The Crew sent me notice, I'm in! I'm getting out of here right now, before shots start flying."\n\n
We shook hands and I wished him well. Glad we could help a guy out... I just hope he doesn't get into any trouble over there.
# only if you did not pick interwebsInstall_option3 or interwebsReport_option2, andy joins us
interwebsEnd_outcome1_outcome1_you= "Well, " he said sheepishly, "I was hoping you guys might have room for an engineer with a penchant for video games? Maybe a programming position?"\n\n
I doubt we have any need for programmers, but I welcomed Andy to join us anyway. Turns out he's also a pilot, in case that ever comes up.
# you agree to keep her secret, +25 respect
interwebsEnd_outcome2_pictureColin2= moore
interwebsEnd_outcome2= "Thank God." she sighed, visibly relieved. Then: "Andy Moore, you can come in now!"
Andy slouched in, looking guilty. Davis sighed again. "I caught this man installing unauthorized software onto my computer. You wouldn't know anything about this, would you...?"\n\n
"...Of course you wouldn't. Well Mr Moore, I'm promoting you to first corporal of the wall. Head to the barracks for your uniform and gun."\n\n
Andy looked at [us] desperately, pleading for an intervention.
interwebsEnd_outcome2_option1= Blame the 1337cREw for it
interwebsEnd_outcome2_option2= Ask if Andy can join us instead
interwebsEnd_outcome2_option3= Say nothing
interwebsEnd_outcome2_outcome1= "The hacker clan?" she mused, "I suppose they must have put him up to it."\n\n
I added that they'd been listening in on the Government's radio broadcasts and poaching their scavenging sites. "Yes," she said, "those cyber-terrorists have been on our watchlist for awhile. Well.. I guess there's no reason to waste a mind like Mr Moore's on this breach of security. We'll just have to keep a closer eye on him and his computers."\n\n
Andy glared at [us], furious at [our] betrayal. Hey, at least he got to keep his job and his pension, right?
# if the leetcrew was previously destroyed
interwebsEnd_outcome2_outcome1_crew_destroyed= "The hacker clan?" she mused, "I suppose they must have put him up to it."\n\n
I added that they'd been listening in on the Government's radio broadcasts and poaching their scavenging sites. "Yes," she said, "I'm glad we took out those cyber-terrorists when we had the chance. Well.. I guess there's no reason to waste a mind like Mr Moore's on this breach of security. We'll just have to keep a closer eye on him and his computers."\n\n
Andy glared at [us], furious at [our] betrayal. Hey, at least he got to keep his job and his pension, right?

# if you did not pick interwebsInstall_option3 or interwebsReport_option2, andy joins us
interwebsEnd_outcome2_outcome2_success= Davis frowned and closed her eyes to think. "I suppose... " she said, "you have shown yourselves to be allies today. And it would get him away from our computers... Okay. You can have him."\n\n
Andy looked ready to burst from joy. "I hope you need an engineer, or a video game designer." He grinned. "I also have my pilot's license if that's useful."\n\n
"And, " he laughed "I'm awful good at Microsoft Solitaire."
interwebsEnd_outcome2_outcome2_fail= Andy stepped in. "Actually, " he said, "I'm mad as hell with the way you guys took advantage of me, and I don't have to take it anymore. I'm through with being a pawn or a passive consumer. I'm going to take action in my life, pick up a gun and take my chances on the wall."
interwebsEnd_outcome2_outcome3= Andy slumped off to the barracks hopelessly. I feel back for the guy, but at least he'll be doing something useful there instead of just playing games all day in an office. Hopefully he'll adapt, like we all have.

# 14. if you turned in the leetcrew either time (interwebsReport_option2 or interwebsEnd_outcome2_option1)

# dara comes by on her way out of town saying it was horrible, they knew we were listening. their scouts radioed in saying they'd found the motherload, undefended fuel and electronics in a lab outside town. they knew we'd come.

interwebsDeathstar_pictureColin= [FactionLeader]
interwebsDeathstar= We met some 1337cREw members leaving the city today, wearing backpacks and looking beaten half to death.\n\n
"I dunno how," Dara said, "but they knew we were listening. We intercepted a message from their scouts... A motherload of undefended fuel and electronics. Jackpot, right? We came to snatch it from them like usual, but they were waiting. The Deathstar was fully operational."\n\n
"They locked us inside, and the zed... most of my people are dead. The rest are getting as far from the Government as we can. We opened our gates, let the zed in. They can have it."

# 15. government destroyed by coup gone wrong
interwebsCoup_title= Coup de Grace
interwebsCoup_picture= sunset
interwebsCoup_pictureColin= false
interwebsCoup= Sounds like that military coup is going down at the Government fort. The one we're pretty much directly responsible for. The two factions must be evenly matched, because they've been at it all day, blowing each other up with their big effing guns.\n\n
Are we going to pick a side?
interwebsCoup_option1= Help the rebels
interwebsCoup_option2= Help Senator Davis
interwebsCoup_option3= Stay out of it
# government destroyed. half their squares turned to rubble
interwebsCoup_outcome1= We tried to stay out of the violence, acting as long-distance scouts for Senator Davis and his rebels. With our help, they could react to the senator's forces quickly, and did so by demolishing up anything in the vicinity with extreme prejudice.\n\n
The Government fort was such a mess by the time it was over that it wasn't clear _what_ they'd won, if anything. After a long meeting, it was decided the survivors would pack up and move on to another, less destroyed city. We wished them well.
# injure mentionedcolin, half of government squares are unfortified & turned to rubble, +25 respect
interwebsCoup_outcome2= Senator Davis was surprised to see us on her side. Honestly, I just didn't want the Government run by someone even more militaristic than she was.\n\n
We joined in the fighting. [FormalName] was shot in the shoulder while personally guarding the senator, right in the thick of things. Davis had been a marine in her youth and still remembered her training.\n\n
We won. Luckily we had no casualties, though the same can't be said for Davis' troops. Their base also took heavy damage... but with our help they can rebuild it.
# lose a random building and its turned to rubble, government destroyed, all their squares turn to rubble
interwebsCoup_outcome3= We tried to lay low until they finished demolishing the place, but the occasional stray RPG still came over our walls. Then one of them landed _on_ the walls, and we lost a {1}.\n\n
After several days of this, the two sides declared a truce among the wreckage. We could see them shaking hands, then going their separate ways: the two groups leaving the city in different directions.\n\n
War: what is it good for?

interwebsReward_outcome1_option2= Stay a perpetual student
interwebsReward_outcome1_option3= Drop out to play video games
interwebsReward_outcome1_option4= Do it all exactly the same
interwebsReward_outcome1_outcome1= I've always had an interest in medicine, but found the ungodly amount of education required pretty daunting. Twelve extra years of studying, tests, and internship before I could even start a practice.\n\n
But I think I'd be ready for it now. I've decided to take it on myself to start studying medicine. I'm going to try to become the doctor I never was.
interwebsReward_outcome1_outcome1_effect= Gained the Doctor perk
interwebsReward_outcome1_outcome2= Why ever leave? I could take courses on french poetry, the philosophy of Star Trek, feminism in pop music, vampire film studies... I could learn sign language or Esperanto or how to build Haida bentwood boxes.\n\n
You know what? We've got books and experts on strange subjects here. I'm going to take myself back to school and try to learn a new subject every month.
interwebsReward_outcome1_outcome2_effect= Gained the College Student perk
interwebsReward_outcome1_outcome3= They say professional e-sports competitors reach their prime at 19. The full-time training required to reach the top leaderboards don't leave much room for college. Parents just don't understand!\n\n
But you know, we've got enough generator power to play video games in the evenings. Maybe it's not too late for me to get back into that noble realm. The problem will be finding someone to compete against...
interwebsReward_outcome1_outcome3_effect= Gained the Pro Gamer perk
interwebsReward_outcome1_outcome4= I have no regrets. I've lived my life the way that felt right at the time. It's all kind of a blur now anyway since the infection. We've all got more pressing things to worry about than the past.

_"I am remembering a doctor from many months ago, here in [CityName]... very strange person, very strange in head. Love ze cricket also. We talk much about it. If I see zis Dr van Nooten again, I will give this cricket bat."_

originMall_title= Shopping Spree
originMall_picture= zombiesMall
originMall_pictureColin= false
originMall= Ah the mall. Undead lining up on the escalators, patiently waiting for them to move again. They window shop, leaning their foreheads against the glass, moaning with desire at the goods within. It's a fine line between pathetic and hilarious.\n\n
[We] finished work early due to [our] fantastic skill, scavenging everything from the obvious shops (sporting goods, bakeries, etc). Since we have time, should we check out one of the smaller shops?
originMall_option1= The toy store
originMall_option2= The pet store
originMall_option3= Kill zombies instead
# +20 happiness for everyone on the mission
originMall_outcome1= [We] spent the afternoon riding tiny kid's bicycles around the "Toys B Us", playing with Nerf guns, jumping on trampolines, and snuggling with life-sized teddy bears. Malls are great! We should do this every day.
originMall_outcome2= Pet stores are sad places now... animals dead in their cages; starved, dehydrated. Oddly all the rats, hamsters, gerbils, and guinea pigs were missing from their cages. Also the section labelled "primates" was completely bare.\n\n
Weird. Whoever took the animals scattered pieces of paper everywhere, or dropped them accidentally. Looks like research by an anthropologist named Dr van Nooten. Something about Haitian ceremonies.\n\n
Voodoo, rats and monkies? Who knows.
# clear all zombies on the mall
originMall_outcome3= A much better use of [our] extra time than tomfoolery. We cleared all the zed out of the mall and went home.

# Clue 3. a schmooze event, where you get a book that ties in to the origin plotline
# any faction
# must have at least 5 schools
# {1} how many schools
originSchmooze= [FactionLeader] and I got to talking about the importance of education. [FactionHe] was impressed to hear that we have a whopping {1} schools in our fort. [FactionHe] says [factionHe]'s got some old books we could stock our libraries with.
originSchmooze_return= [FactionLeader's] still offering us those books for our schools.
originSchmooze_option1= Take the Non-fiction textbooks
originSchmooze_option2= Take the fiction books
# get KS_SCIENCE_BOOK
originSchmooze_outcome1= Most were kind of outdated. The astronomy texts showed Pluto as a planet - hah! But at least one textbook in here should be useful for our engineers.
# +2 fort happiness "Trashy romance novels... my guilty pleasure"
originSchmooze_outcome2= Mostly trashy romance novels, but somehow somebody's diary slipped in there. It's dated the year of the outbreak, with the name "I. G. van Nooten" on the cover. It's in... Dutch I guess?\n\n
"Vecht met Ruben. Hendrik keert terug uit Haiti binnenkort. Het is tijd dat we hem verteld, maar Ruben zegt nee."\n\n
All I understand are the names Ruben, Hendrik, and Haiti. That's the last entry. Someone wrote "CONTAGION CONTAGION CONTAGION" over the rest until they were too dark to read. Creepy...
# "Fighting with Ruben again. Hendrik will return from Haiti soon. I think it is time we told him, but Ruben disagrees."\n\n

originMob= A mob of zed attacked [us] while [we] [were] out [missioning]. I should have been watching, but I had my nose stuffed in an old newspaper with the headline: "ZOMBIES: Where do they come from?"\n\n
Being such a curious [man] of science, I had to know! Apparently, I read, a Dutch cult named the "Tulp Bloem Collectief" took credit for creating it. They said they wanted to cleanse the world of the evils of capitalism...
originMob_option1= Read on...
originMob_option2= Run you idiot! Zombies!!
originMob_outcome1= But this reporter for the [CityName] Times thought the cult lied, and they had nothing to do with it.\n\n
The evidence? The first reported cases were weeks earlier from Dodenakker Hospitaal in the small town of Winterswijk, which had no connection to the cult. They quarantined two patients named Ruben Willemsen and Hendrik van Nooten... but I guess the disease still got out somehow. Fascinating...\n\n
Oh! Right! Zombies! Gotta run!
originMob_outcome2= Oh, right. Yeah [we] got the heck out of there ahead of that mob. Not a scratch, see? No worries.

originJoin= We found a woman was hanging around outside our gates today. She put her cupped hands out to beg for food and seemed skittish when I approached.\n\n
She'd been out there alone for awhile and I guess the world took its toll. After a cup of hot soup she nervously told me about herself. She was a scientist from Europe, stranded here by the disease. She saw our signs and hoped we could help...\n\n
When I asked her to join us, her eyes misted over and she nodded. Welcome, [Name]. I hope you find happiness here.

High fever, white spots in the mouth, and bloodshot, dilated eyes... all the signs of the zombie disease. I'm afraid it's too late to do anything but make [him2] comfortable.\n\n
The weird thing is, there are no bites on [his2] body, and [he2]'s had no contact with zed in 48 hours. We don't know how [he2] caught the disease. Upsetting...

[He] and [FormalName2] were cleaning our storeroom when they found a rat eating through a sack of rice. [Name2] killed it. Then [Name] went ballistic.

originLeave_outcome1= I talked with [Name] for an hour, but [he] just wouldn't open up to me. [He] won't even let other people touch [him].\n\n
We discussed meditation and breathing exercises, and I thought I'd at least convinced [him] to work harder to control [his] emotions. But the next morning [he]'d packed all [his] things and left us.\n\n
Maybe it's for the best. It's too bad that we couldn't fix whatever was broken inside [Name], but... some people might be better off alone.
originLeave_outcome2= It was hard to do it, but I sat [Name] down to talk about options other than living with us. Maybe another faction would take [him] in? Or, well, maybe some people are just better off alone. I mean, [he] won't even let other people touch [him]. The [man] has real issues, not even counting the attempted eye-removal.\n\n
[Name] heard me out, then sighed and said it was probably time. [He] was gone by nightfall. I feel bad but... we have to worry about the rest of the fort too. I hope [he]'ll be okay out there.

# 8. any mission in any motel, after you have all 4 of the clues and gretchen left (7)
# starts a quest mission on a hospital
originMotel_title= Ed's End of the Line Motel
originMotel_picture= parking
originMotel_pictureColin= false
originMotel= The rooms were wood-paneled and accented with lime-green and vomit-orange in horrible 70s design. The motel was mostly empty, but in one room a suitcase with the initials "I.G.v.N" made my scavenger senses tingle.\n\n
I dug through the clothes and found a softbound book titled _Alouatta Seniculus_ by Dr van Nooten. It's a study on some kind of South American monkey. The margins are filled with scribbled notes, drawings of brains and repeated phrases in Dutch and English. They used four different colored highlighters.
originMotel_option1= Search the rest of the room
originMotel_outcome1= There was a phone book on the desk, open to a list of medical facilities. "Woodlands General Hospital" is highlighted in green and its address is circled over and over until the pen started to cut through the page. Was I. G. van Nooten sick?\n\n
It has an address nearby... maybe we should head there to investigate further. I'm dying to know if van Nooten can tell us where the zombie disease came from.

# 9. hospital quest mission finished
# go to Woodlands General Hospital. Get list of last admitted patients. 4 patients possible: One homeless man exhibiting violent behavior, brought in by police. Woman in coma with unknown chronic condition, admitted by husband. Man admitted claiming hair falling out after neighbor cursed him. Woman exhibiting signs of sickness after finding strange stone she claims was from space. Player can check the rooms of any of the four (5-8)
# at each step, offer the remaining options until option 3 (coma patient) is chosen.
originHospital_title= Woodlands General
originHospital_picture= hospital
originHospital_pictureColin= false
originHospital= They quarantined this hospital early on, boarding up the doors and windows and stringing police tape everywhere. To keep looters out... or keep whatever was inside from escaping?\n\n
[We] pried the boards off the front door and made [our] way through silent, blood smeared halls to reception. They used a confusing system that referred to patients by their initials, for patient confidentiality I suppose.\n\n
There were four who might be our "I. G. van Nooten". Which should [we] check first?
# show remainders until option3 is chosen then no more
originHospital_option1= The violent homeless man
originHospital_option2= The man claiming he was cursed
originHospital_option3= The coma patient
originHospital_option4= The woman with the space rock
# Violent patient: Substance abuser going through a violent withdrawal. Had police record. Body is found strapped to the hospital bed where he was obviously eaten alive.
originHospitalHomeless= Bloodstains covered the bed and floor where the disemboweled remains of a former patient were still strapped to the gurney. Judging from the bite marks, looks like somebody ate this guy for dinner.\n\n
Piecing through his scattered patient records, it looked like "Iggy Valentine" was a regular here. After five visits for substance abuse, the doc figured this was the last time they'd see him walk through those doors upright. They were right.\n\n
Not van Nooten. [We]'ll have to keep looking.
# Cursed patient: Nothing wrong with them. Signs point to him jumping from window after being cornered.
originHospitalCursed= This patient's room was covered in bird droppings and leaves blown in through the open window. Flipping through the patient report, it seems "Ian Vickers" came in claiming he'd been inflicted with a voodoo curse. The doctor's evaluation was that he was "unstable and prone to delusions".\n\n
He was still lucid enough to make a fight or flight choice when the undead came for him. From the stain on the car roof four floors below, [we]'ve got a good idea of how the 'flight' went for him.\n\n
Not van Nooten. [We]'ll have to keep looking.
# Sick patient: Rock was irradiated uranium and patient now suffering radiation poisoning. Patient locked in isolation and appears to have starved to death.
originHospitalRock= This room is securely locked with warning signs all around. The report beside the door says "Imelda Vasquez" had been hearing voices after she found a glowing rock in her backyard. She called it her "radio to heaven".\n\n
Lab reports showed that the rock was highly radioactive, and Imelda was suffering from acute radiation poisoning. Looking at her desiccated husk through the door's viewing window, I guess she died of starvation trapped in that tiny room by herself.\n\n
Not van Nooten. [We]'ll have to keep looking.
# found her - now search the room (must do all 3 options)
# creates a quest to find isa on a school next
originHospitalIsa= This room is empty and nearly spotless. No body, and no blood. I expected to find at least _one_ zombie...\n\n
But [we] did find Dr van Nooten! Sort of. According to her chart, Isa Gretchen van Nooten came in very distraught, complaining of "an infection of the brain and glands" and insisting she get a full set of blood work done. The nurses had a hard time calming her down, and of course they didn't believe her.\n\n
Then, it says, she collapsed. Just boom, on the floor of the waiting room, unconscious.
# show remainders until all 3 have been chosen
originHospitalIsa_option1= Read the rest of the chart
originHospitalIsa_option2= Check the cupboards
originHospitalIsa_option3= Go through the garbage
originHospitalIsa_outcome1= They moved her to this room and took readings. Pulse: normal. Breathing: normal. Brain activity: normal. Was she faking it? She didn't flinch when they drew blood.\n\n
Hemoglobin: normal. White blood cells: normal. Platelets: normal. Glucose, calcium, electrolytes: all normal. What was wrong with this woman, if anything?\n\n
That night, she disappeared. The last entry was a notice to locate her, as several nurses who'd treated her were now very ill. They were worried Isa might have caught something from them.
# +10 medicine
originHospitalIsa_outcome2= I guess nobody got around to looting this room. The cupboards were still packed full of medical supplies. I'm sure we can find a use for those.\n\n
No other clues about Isa van Nooten here though. Her records just say "Holland". Besides Ed's End of the Line Motel, I wonder where else she might have gone after leaving this hospital...
originHospitalIsa_outcome3= Gum wrappers, gas receipts, balled up menu from a buffet called "Uncle Willy's"... with ramblings in all the blank spaces, in three colors of pen and highlighter. Looks like our I. G. van Nooten!\n\n
What else is in here... A business card from a man in the anthropology department of [CityName] College. A campus map of the same place... and a letter inviting Isa van Nooten to lecture there. Bingo!\n\n
The campus is nearby. We should head there to search for Dr. van Nooten.

# 10. finishing the school search mission
# [Name] - person isa killed way long ago
# [name2] - "gretchen" who joined our fort once
originSchool_title= Isa van Nooten
originSchool_picture= diseaseOrigin
originSchool_pictureColin= false
originSchool_pictureColin2= false
originSchool= [We] followed the campus map to Dr. van Nooten's office in the anthropology department. The invitation we found said she'd come from Holland to teach a course on ritual in modern culture. The disease must have hit halfway into her term and stranded her here.\n\n
[We] knew something was wrong when we got close. The rest of the building was deserted, but here the scent of desiccated flesh was intense. And something else, a funky incense smell like burned garden waste. Dirty footprints led up to the door of room 308, her office.
originSchool_option1= Push open the door
originSchool_outcome1= The door stuck on something so [we] slipped through the crack and held [our] [p|nose|noses].\n\n
Every square inch of wall had notes pinned to it. Repeated phrases (why me why me why me?), long stories in Dutch, and sketches of human and animal anatomy in various colored pens. Some of it was written right onto the wall, and there were muddy hand-prints and what might be dried blood incorporated too.\n\n
It looked like a serial killer's den. [We] [were] nervous.
originSchool_outcome1_option1= Investigate further
originSchoolTalk_pictureColin2= true
originSchoolTalk= Dead rodents all around [us], on the floor and in cages. Some had been placed in little shrines with candles and tiny figures made from sticks. Bundles of herbs had been burned regularly, either in ritual or to cover the smell of decay. All in this one little unventilated office.\n\n
After a minute of gawking, [we] found Isa. She was bundled in blankets under a desk, filthy and wild, but alive. She eyed us suspiciously. There was something familiar about her...\n\n
That's it! She was Gretchen the engineer! She used to live with us! What should [we] say to her?
# have to ask all 4, hide ones we've already asked
originSchoolTalk_option1= We were nice to you, remember?
originSchoolTalk_option2= Gustav told us you like cricket...
originSchoolTalk_option3= Who are Hendrik and Ruben?
originSchoolTalk_option4= What's with all the dead rats?
originSchoolTalk_outcome1= "I remember" she mumbled. "It was my fault, [Name], that [man] who died. I should never have touched [him]. Should never have left this place. I am infected."\n\n
She bundled herself further under the desk. "You can't detect it. I tried once, at a hospital. I pretended... they drew my blood and said I was healthy. But I'm not."\n\n
"So go away. I will infect you too."
originSchoolTalk_outcome2= Her eyes kind of lost focus. "When I was a child in Holland," she said, "my father took me to cricket matches. Hendrik, my husband, was also fond of the game..."\n\n
Isa trailed off, then looked sad again. She pulled a long knife from under her blanket and started stabbing it slowly into the floor.\n\n
"He was so angry when he found out." she whispered. "He could never forgive us."
originSchoolTalk_outcome3= "Ruben was my lover." she stared sadly at the floor. "My husband Hendrik was away so often... his long research trips to Haiti... it just happened."\n\n
"Hendrik was an anthropologist like me. He studied voodoo. When he discovered I was cheating on him, he... he brought something back with him from Haiti. The blood of an animal."\n\n
"It... he.... he meant for both of us to die. But I did not."
originSchoolTalk_outcome4= She threw her hands over her face, scratching and sobbing. "I injected them with my blood! Trying to find a solution. But they didn't live. Like all the people, I killed them!"\n\n
Isa cried for awhile, then said quietly: "I'm no biologist. I tried ceremony next. Maybe ritual was the key. I read all his notes..."\n\n
She reached into her blanket and threw a notebook at [us]. "You can have them. Now go away before I kill you too!"
# once all 4 options above are chosen, show these ones
originSchoolNext= This text is never displayed
originSchoolNext_option1= Read the notebook
originSchoolNext_option2= Tell Isa she didn't kill anybody
originSchoolNext_option3= Accuse Isa of killing everybody
# all 3 notebook options lead here
originSchoolNotebook= It was Henrick van Nooten's notes from his final trip to Haiti, in crisp English. He was studying a _vodou bokor_: a black sorcerer who claimed to raise the dead. When a client paid him to target someone, he would sneak monkey's blood into the target's drink. The target would fall ill and die, then come back to life as a docile and easily controlled zombie. A revenge worse than death for your enemies.\n\n
The _bokor_ raised red howler monkeys, _Alouatta seniculus_, whose blood he said was magical. Henrick was determined to bring a sample back to Holland.
# show only Continue... if we already forgave/accused, otherwise only the other two
originSchoolNotebook_option1= Continue...
# go to forgive
originSchoolNotebook_option2= Tell Isa she didn't kill anybody
# go to accuse
originSchoolNotebook_option3= Accuse Isa of killing everybody
# both Tell her she didn't kill anybody options go here
originSchoolForgive= "But I did!" she shouted, stabbing the floor harder. "When my husband poisoned us, I didn't know. Ruben was quarantined, but I was fine. I didn't know I had it too!"\n\n
"When Henrick also fell ill, I read his notes and knew he poisoned Ruben. But the disease was different with Henrick. He was violent. I never guessed it was me who infected him. I didn't think! I ran."\n\n
"Spain, India, China, Japan, then here. I infected them all. I killed the whole world!"\n\n
She raised the knife over her chest.
originSchoolForgive_option1= Stop her!
originSchoolForgive_option2= It's too late...
# both Accuse her of killing everybody options go here
originSchoolAccuse= Isa stopped stabbing the floor. "You are right." she said quietly. "After Henrik infected me with that blood... I didn't realize. I went to lecture in other countries. I traveled to Spain, India, China, Japan. Then here. Every person I touched, I made them sick."\n\n
She raised the knife. "If it wasn't for me, they would all still be alive. I killed the whole world."\n\n
Before [we] could stop her, she drove the knife into her chest.
originSchoolAccuse_option1= It's too late...
# Stop her! goes here
originSchoolStop= I jumped forward and grabbed the knife from Isa's hands. She burst into tears again and doubled over in her blanket, sobbing.\n\n
Patient zero... or more like the Typhoid Mary of zombieism. No wonder she can't live with herself. The problem is... she can't live with us either. It's too dangerous.\n\n
[We] quietly backed away and left Isa there. [We] came back the next day to leave supplies, but there was no sign of her.
# show only Continue if we already read the notebook, otherwise only show Read the notebook
originSchoolStop_option1= Continue...
originSchoolStop_option2= Read the notebook
# both "it's too late" options go here
originSchoolLate= [We] stared down at the growing puddle of blood on the floor. Poor woman; the original infected; the Tyhoid Mary of zombieism. Nobody could feel responsible for billions of deaths and live with that guilt. Or even stay sane.\n\n
There was nothing anyone could have done but put an end her misery. At least she's not in pain anymore.
# show only Continue if we already read the notebook, otherwise only show Read the notebook
originSchoolLate_option1= Continue...
originSchoolLate_option2= Read the notebook
# all 3 Continue... options go here
originSchoolTalkContinue= As we left, a vial of dark liquid and a letter fell out of the back of Henrick's notebook. We took it back and translated it:\n\n
"My darling Isa, I know I have been away too long, and your eyes have wandered in my absence. But I am bringing home a substance which will make you mine again. Body and soul. After I put it in your drink, you will feel a fever, but you will wake and love me again with the devotion of our early days."

The man was delirious and bleeding, but unarmed. We tentatively opened the door and he barged in huffing.

He could still talk, I mean, and he seemed to be running things and giving orders to the others. He was pretty high strung, and mean."\n\n
"The rest all had these weird Halloween masks, like animals and stuff... I think. Unless I was just seeing things as a side effect from all the drugs... I guess that's possible, eh?"

It was that damn ninja again, up on the roof of a nearby building. But by the time [Name2] found a way up there, it was gone.\n\n
At least they both made it back to the fort unharmed!

hopeBillocide3_2= [Name] can't even take a crap these days without some masked ninja trying to incapacitate [him].\n\n
[He] was out [missioning] with [Name2] when a cloud of smoke enveloped them both...

A knife flashed through the mists and cut deeply into [his2] arm. Somehow [he2] managed to grapple the attacker and they wrestled blindly through the smoke... But when the smoke cleared the ninja was gone. [Name2] and [Name] were grappling each other.\n\n
[Name's] injured, but at least they both survived the attack.

hopeBillocide3_outcome3Success= [Name2] flailed about at the smoke. Somehow [he2] managed to grapple the attacker and get the knife out of its grip. \n\n
When the smoke cleared they removed its mask: it was an older woman with a hideous scar across her face that had taken her nose with it.\n\n
They asked her name, who does she work for, and why try to kill [Name], but she said nothing. She waited for the right moment then, without hesitation, wriggled free, grabbed the knife, and slit her own throat.

[Name2] followed right on its heels. A little too close; [he2] rounded a corner and found [himself2] skewered on the ninja's long knife.\n\n
It's a miracle the stab wound didn't kill [him2], but there's a reason we picked [Name2] for bodyguard duty. [He2]'s tough. [He2]'ll recover. And [Name] is safe.

Whether it was an assassination or a botched kidnapping, [Name] is dead. We're sorry we sent [him] out there to [his] fate alone.

The poor dog {1} ate a couple dates from [Name's] hand. Then the old boy keeled right over dead, just as [Name] was about to pop one in [his] mouth.\n\n

"I'm horrified that you would even suggest my people would do something like that. Whoever this [FormalName] is, I've never even met [him]."\n\n

Jesse tipped his finger to his hat in greeting. "Howdy partners. I didn't expect your ugly pink mugs - no offence, mind - to turn up in this here little mountain town. What brings you to [CityName]?"
hopeRottenIntro_option1= Accuse him of kidnapping [Name]
hopeRottenIntro_option2= Say we're just here for the fresh air

"Now I should be offended, but this is the sort of attitude we Rotten are used to from you folk. Nobody seems to get that we ain't evil."\n\n
"He says there was a Rotten there? Well, I'll swear to you that it wasn't one of us. I know, because we're here to find that lab too but don't have a clue where it is. Let us know if you find it."
hopeRottenIntro_outcome2= "Oh sure," Jesse drawled. "This fresh mountain air's a real tonic for the constitution. Perks you up better than a shot of Tabasco in the eye."\n\n
"Well if you ain't sayin', then I ain't sayin' neither. But if you happen to come across some kind of underground facility type deal here in [CityName], let us know."\n\n
He winked. "We're looking for it too."
hopeRottenIntro_outcome3= "The same reason you are." Jesse looked me straight in the eyes. "To find that lab and the cure for zombieism."\n\n
I was shocked at his honesty. We just started at each other for a minute.\n\n
"Listen," he said, "we'll help if we can, but right now we're as clueless as a camel at the North Pole... as regards to the location that is. So come back and let old Jesse know if you find the place."

"So, the plan: I'll tell the cultists we want to join them. They'll no doubt put us up like kings, at the cost of our dignity and sanity. Then, when your soldiers attack, we'll strike from the inside."\n\n
We shook on it. Now to attack the Church of the Chosen Ones and hope Jesse fills his end of the bargain.
hopeRottenHelp_outcome2= "That's a shame." Jesse frowned. "You know they're fixing to make more folks like us, right? I'd bet donkeys to donuts that's what they need that cure for."\n\n
"We, on the other hand, just want to be human again. So think of old Jesse if you do get your hands on that cure somehow. Good luck, and hey:"\n\n

After a startled moment, we heard his voice over the PA system:\n\n
"Hahaha, good try, but I'm behind three feet of solid steel and I've got all the research with me. You shouldn't have teamed up with the Rotten. They're useless. No imagination. They want to be _cured_ for god's sake! Who wants to be human again? Not me!"
hopeEnterJesse_option1= Being human's not so bad...
hopeEnterJesse_outcome1= "I can't hear you." Clark voice echoed over the PA. "But you're probably whining about how great it is to be alive. You're wrong! Once I get this cure synthesized, I'll make an army of undead warriors. Super strong and impervious to pain, but I'll stop the disease before they forget how to use weapons or obey commands. Then I'll rule the world hahahaha ha!"\n\n

I was about to say that _Jesse_ was the one who drew his gun and ruined our dialog, but he's right: explosives. We'll bring a heap of them down here and blow the door off that vault. Just as soon as we deal with all these zombies...

I asked what that had to do with Clark's undead army, but she shook her head.

He's right, we're going to need help to put this cure into production. Guess it's time to leave Hope and move on.

"Not for me." he said. "They're for a friend. He... he gets scared sometimes when he's up on that wall dealing with the zed. He's afraid he might lose his wits one day and they'll get the better of him. Having these around, just in his pocket, it helps calm his nerves."

"Listen," she said, "I can't just make decisions for the group okay? I'll see what I can do about getting that lab for you, but you're gonna have to try a bit harder to impress us first."\n\n
I guess we'll have to ally with them after all.
cureReturnPharmacists_outcome2= I told her we were trying to brew beer.\n\n
Tiff laughed. "A noble purpose, if only I believed you. You don't need a sophisticated setup like ours to make beer."\n\n
"Nope, whatever it is you want to do, you're gonna have to work for it. Move some more product, do some more odd jobs. Then we can talk about that lab."\n\n
I guess we'll have to ally with them after all.

cureExtractColin= [Name] looked terrified when I called [him] forward. [He] stammered, worrying about the danger of the operation and the chances of brain damage or death.\n\n
This quickly deteriorated to blubbering about not wanting to die and begging me to pick someone else.
cureExtractColin_option1= Convince [him] to do it (leadership)
cureExtractColin_option2= Force [him]
cureExtractColin_option3= Volunteer myself
cureExtractColin_outcome1success= I spoke quietly with [Name] for a few minutes and tried to help [him] see this in perspective. [He]'d outlived the initial infection, then years of running from the undead, of starvation and illness. This little operation to harvest just a few brain cells wasn't going to kill [him].\n\n
Honestly, it very well might. But I convinced [Name] to be brave about it and take one for the team.
cureExtractColin_outcome1success_option1= Start the Extraction...
cureExtractColin_outcome1fail= [Name] is really serious about not wanting to go through with this operation. Saying "but think of the children!" had no effect on [him] at all.\n\n
I guess none of us survived this long by thinking of the children. If there's one thing the zombie apocalypse has taught us, it's to run away when the going gets tough.\n\n
So, [Name] won't go willingly. What do we do?
cureExtractColin_outcome1fail_option1= Force [him]
cureExtractColin_outcome1fail_option2= Volunteer myself
cureExtractColin_outcome1fail_outcome1= I would have rather done this with [Name's] consent, but either way it must be done. This is for the greater good of the human race.\n\n
I nodded to the rotten scientists who grabbed [Name] from behind and forced [him] onto a gurney. As they strapped [him] in, I forced myself to look into [his] terrified eyes.\n\n
I told [him] it was going to be okay.

cureExtractColin_outcome2= I nodded to the rotten scientists who grabbed [Name] from behind and forced [him] onto a gurney. As they strapped [him] in, I forced myself to look into [his] terrified eyes.\n\n

There's a reason I keep surviving when others fall. Why the disease passed me by. This must be it.

They took what we needed and tried to close [him] back up... but it was too much for [his] fragile body. [His] heartbeat became erratic... then weak... then gone.\n\n
We are indebted to [FormalName] for [his] sacrifice. We have everything we need now to research the cure.

# replace above if Jesse volunteered, nobody dies
cureExtractStartJesse= And I thought the Rotten smelled bad on the outside. Yuck, is that a... worm? No, no, just brains. The doctors harvested the tissue we need and sewed Jesse back up. When they were done he bounced out of bed. I asked how he felt.\n\n
"Just as lit as a riddle!" he answered, then realized that was wrong. "Err... as fat as a puddle? Swift as a... dribble? Aw hell."\n\n
Like lightning, Jesse drew a pistol from his pocket, spun around, and shot two beakers clean off a shelf. Satisfied, he nodded. He'll be fine. We now have everything we need to research the cure.

cureExtractStartMyself= They injected me with something and had me count backwards from 10. Blackness. Then out of it I saw Diane Moon from long ago. She was smiling, and I could feel she was proud of me. She leaned in to whisper:\n\n
"Don't drop the tomatoes. They're very ripe."\n\n
I realized I was clutching an armload of tomatoes and struggled to keep hold of them all, then I woke up. My head hurts. I feel weak and am having trouble remembering stuff, but they say I'll live.\n\n

It seems the disease may be what is keeping the Rotten alive now. Killing the disease kills them.\n\n
Jesse says a number of the Rotten are so desperate to be human again that they want to take the cure anyway, in the small hope that it will work for them.

# alliance with rotten and they get -25 strength

"There are plenty of survivors out there who need this cure." Jesse told us. "Hurry and help them so they don't turn out like us Rotten. Or worse."\n\n
"As for me," he said, "I'm fixing to mosey off on my own for awhile. Maybe find a desert to wander for a few years. I reckon I might find something out there that'll explain all this."
# rotten destroyed
cureRottenDie_outcome2= We encouraged the Rotten to try the cure. Even if it doesn't work, at least it'll end their miserable existence.\n\n
Most of them took it. They all died.\n\n
Jesse decided not to. "You should bring that cure to the human folks in other cities." he told me. "But as for me, I'm fixing to mosey off on my own for awhile. Maybe find a desert to wander for a few years. I reckon I might find something out there that'll explain all this."\n\n

vanDemand_1= [FactionLeader] stormed through our gates with [factionAdjective] soldiers on [factionHis] heels.\n\n
[FactionHe] demanded that we supply them with this vaccine we've "been keeping secret all this time."\n\n
Honestly, it was pretty rude. What should we do?
vanDemand_2= [Faction] have come to ask for our cure. Specifically, they'd like a few doses for their soldiers on the frontlines; those most likely to be bitten by zed.\n\n
"And of course, " [factionHe] added, "one dose for myself."
vanDemand_3= [FactionLeader] is practically begging us for our cure. [FactionHe] says they lost their doctor last week when she was treating an infected patient. There was no bite... she just got a bit of the patient's blood in an open cut.\n\n
[FactionHe] implored me to give them just 10 doses before many more lives could be lost.
vanDemand_luddies= Ludd started talking before I even opened the gate.\n\n
"Normally I'd be suspicious about this so-called vaccine for zombieism. What are the side effects? Have there been any long-term trials? How do we know it's safe for children? But once you've seen the effects of a disease like this, you take protection seriously. When you weigh the risk accordingly, getting vaccinated is the intelligent choice."\n\n
Shocking clarity coming from someone so afraid of wifi signals and contrails. Should we offer them our cure?

vanDemand_outcome1= [FactionLeader] carefully accepted the box of delicate vials. [FactionHe] told me they have plenty to trade if we have any more of the vaccine to sell.
# gain {1}
vanDemand_outcome2= [FactionLeader] grudgingly accepted the deal. [FactionHe] figured, wisely, that {1} wouldn't do them much good if they were all dead.
# alliance
vanDemand_outcome3= I shook [FactionLeader's] hand. They've pledged to defend us and share whatever they can with us in exchange for the vaccine.\n\n
If we have any more, we can trade it to them for a good price later.
# go to war
vanDemand_outcome4= I told [FactionLeader] we were flat out of the stuff, but of course [factionHe] didn't believe me.\n\n
[FactionHe] said this would only mean one thing: war. Though [Faction] didn't want to fight us, a cure for zombieism was one thing worth fighting for. Keeping it from them was like denying them a future.\n\n
I nodded and told [factionHim] we'd see them on the battlefield, then.

I said it's hard to tell what's strange anymore and she nodded distractedly. "Our people are." she said. "All the ones that got the first round of vaccine we stole from you."\n\n
"Oh - sorry." she added. "Yeah, we did that. But anyway, keep an eye out, okay?"

[Name] chased him to the edge of our wall where Clark wriggled under it through a hole he'd dug. [Name] tried to follow him but felt a stabbing pain in [his] hand.\n\n
It was probably because [his] hand had been stabbed. Clark put a rather large hole in it.\n\n
Clark laughed maniacally from the other side of the wall. Looks like he got away again.

vanVillain_outcome1_outcome2= [Name] missed on the first shot, then the second went wild and hit the roof above Clark's head. It knocked a shingle loose, which slide down and smacked Clark on the head.\n\n
"Ouch! Watch where you aim that thing!" he shouted, then wriggled under our wall and away into the city.\n\n
Whatever he was planning to do, at least we stopped it. But we probably haven't seen the last of him.

They brought me to the Government base to meet with Senator Davis. She could have just asked me to visit...\n\n
"How are you feeling?" Davis asked me. "Our intelligence reports your survivors look a bit... green... lately. And I see you have a tremor in your hands. We are concerned that you may be a danger to [CityName]."

"Have you ever heard the term 'Manifest Destiny'? My forefathers considered _all_ of North America to be the rightful domain of the American people. Seizing control of Canadian cities during a crisis was just one of many scenarios we had plans for. Thanks to you, it'll be easy to take control of the rest."\n\n
What does she mean by that? Why is Davis being so honest all of a sudden...?
# grey out option2 and reveal option3
vanGovernment_outcome2= "All _you've_ done?" Davis frowned. "Once again you fail to see the big picture."\n\n
"All you've done so far is muck about establishing small, dissociated communes run by ill-prepared committees. That's not _government_. You don't know the first thing about keeping a population under control. Within a few years, every one of your 'rebuilt' cities will crumble and return to the zombies."\n\n

"You see," he explained, "that vaccine you're spreading about town has been tainted from the start. That wasn't a cure you stole from me, it was a stronger, slower acting strain of zombieism. The Omegavirus!!!"\n\n
"Now everyone's infected! Muahahaha! Even you! Have you been experiencing tremors, hallucinations, violent outbursts? Just a matter of time. Once your former personality is stripped and broken, I'll mold you into the perfect soldier."

Clark fell over backwards, two bullet holes in his forehead. Davis turned to me with a smoking pistol in her hand.\n\n

Just like a pelican eating a cat.

I picked it up and wrung its neck with a quick twist, like killers do in the movies. It lay limp in my hand and I just stared at it for awhile.\n\n
Then I skinned, gutted, and ate it. Let no meat go to waste.

Hiding behind their walls, squirreling away resources for winter. Living like pathetic grubs. We couldn't help ourselves. Just watching them scurry about the city was enough to make you want to scream.\n\n

vanBecomeRotten= [FormalName's] been sick with what we though was some kind of stomach bug. [He]'s as green as a frog and everything that goes down comes right back up again. The only thing [he]'ll even try to stomach anymore is the occasional bit of very rare meat.\n\n
[He]'s been inappropriately chipper about the whole thing, cracking jokes about watching [his] figure and trying to figure out if [his] new skin tone is more of a winter or a spring.
vanBecomeRottenAgain= Another survivor reached the necrotic skin stage of the Omegavirus. Like one of the Rotten, [FormalName's] looking a little green.\n\n
[He] also lost [his] appetite for regular food... I thought [he] was just sick, until I caught [him] wiping blood off [his] chin. Now I know [he] must be finding something else to eat.
vanBecomeRottenLeader= I'm nearly one of them now. The fever has come. My heartbeat is so weak I can hardly feel it.\n\n
Something else is animating me now. The Omegavirus creeps through my veins and nests in my spinal column, killing me and keeping me alive at the same time. My skin is changing color as the blood leaves it forever.\n\n
The hallucinations are worse now. Fantasies of rage and violence. I can hardly tell what's real and what's a dream. I'm losing my mind... but I've never felt more powerful.

vanRaid= Agents from the Government are here to raid us, but they aren't after our food or medicine... they've come for [Name]. They consider [his] Omegavirus infection advanced enough that it's time to add [him] to their military ranks.\n\n
They busted down our gate and shoved guns in our faces. They're demanding we turn over [Name] or things will get bloody.
# replace with this the 2nd+ time 
vanRaidAgain= They drove a tank right through our wall then piped demands out through a loudspeaker. They want to us to turn over [FormalName] so [he] can become a soldier in their army.\n\n
[Name's] in the late states of Omegavirus infection, but [he]'s still one of ours. What should we do?
vanRaid_option1= Fight them
vanRaid_option2= Bribe them with 30 food
vanRaid_option3= Give them [Name]
# roll 50/50 no problem
vanRaid_outcome1_success= Take one of our people? _Never_.\n\n
We fought like demons and tore those Government bastards limb from limb in an orgy of destruction. They're right about one thing: this Omegavirus has made us strong.
# someone else is injured
vanRaid_outcome1_fail= Any excuse to tear a few heads off\n\n
They must have been expecting a firefight but we pounced on them like animals. Knives, fists, teeth. We tore them apart like the mindless zombies they want us to become. So long as we have a shred of humanity left, we'll defend it to the death.\n\n
[Name] was shot during the fight but [he] says [he] can barely feel it. Another benefit of the Omegavirus.
# lose -30 food
vanRaid_outcome2= What do we need for for anyway? Soon the Omegavirus will take all our appetites. They can have it.
# [Name] is killed, government gets +10 strength

[FormalName] is now stronger than ever.
vanStrength_effect= Gained {1} and {2} perks
# replace with this the 2nd+ time 
vanStrengthAgain_1= The Omegavirus brings us visions, uncontrollable rages, and power. So much power.\n\n
Our bodies are becoming unstoppable machines. Even death won't stop them. [FormalName] tells me it feels sometimes like [he] could jump off a building and land running, or rip a man in two with [his] bare hands.\n\n
I advised [him] to maybe not try either of these things unless actually necessary.
vanStrengthAgain_2= [FormalName] is feeling good today. Very good.\n\n
[He]'s been having trouble with Omegavirus symptoms lately: upset stomach, nightmares, mild hallucinations. But today [he] woke up feeling stronger than ever. [He] can't wait to get out there and bust some Government heads.

vanSoldiers= Today's attack on the Government went poorly. [FormalName] was quietly working on their back gate with a pair of bolt cutters when it suddenly swung open on its own.\n\n
Out marched dozens, maybe hundreds of green-skinned soldiers, armed with body armor and assault rifles. They have the vacant, soulless eyes of the undead, but move like trained soldiers.\n\n
These must be the Omegavirus-infected supersoldiers that Senator Davis wants to turn us all into.

vanDavis= This war.... for months we've torn down the Government's walls and killed countless soldiers. I thought we'd seen it all... but today we found something new.\n\n
A silo, heavily guarded in the heart of their compound. Hazard symbols and radiation warnings all over it.\n\n
I was musing over what might be inside when Senator Davis appeared.
vanDavis_option1= Greet her as a worthy opponent
vanDavis_option2= Taunt and threaten her
vanDavis_outcome1_pictureColin2= [FactionLeader]
vanDavis_outcome1= "Why thank you." she said. "I've been wondering when you would find this silo. Inside lies unimaginable power. But we have something even more powerful now: the Omegavirus."\n\n
She looked me up and down. "I see your transformation is nearly complete. Soon you won't be able to control yourself at all. Join us, and we will train you, make you a General. You'll be unstoppable."\n\n

I noticed soldiers creeping up beside us...
vanDavis_outcome2_option1= Run Away!
vanDavis_outcome2_option2= Surrender to the Government
vanDavis_escape= I bit a soldier on the neck (just an impulse, I swear I wasn't trying to eat him!) and we got the hell out of there.\n\n
The Government must have had reserve troops and supplies, because they repelled us and put new walls up before we even made it back home.\n\n
This war is hopeless... there's just too many of them. I'm running out of time (and sanity)... I'm afraid I might not have a choice but to either detonate that bomb, or join the Government...
vanDavis_surrender= I let Governments soldiers shackle my wrists and lead me away.\n\n
"This is only temporary." Davis explained. "Once your training is complete, we'll tame that Omegavirus and you won't be a danger to anyone but enemies of the state."\n\n
"Your government thanks you, citizen."

vanJesse_picture= gate2
vanJesse_pictureColin= rotten
vanJesse= I admit, I didn't expect to ever see Jesse again after he took off wandering. He showed up today lugging a filthy duffel bag. The dust has settled deep into the lines on his face, giving him an ancient and oddly wise appearance.\n\n
"Howdy parders." he tipped his hat in his usual greeting. "I've got news you'll want to hear, if you're willing to talk about your research on the cure."
vanJesse_option1= Share our research
vanJesse_option2= Chase him away
vanJesse_outcome1= Jesse leaned in close to look at my face. "_Hot mustard_, you look more Rotten than I do. I reckon your hourglass is near empty if you've got the Omegavirus like those Pharmacists."\n\n
"They're in no condition to help. They're having trouble just not eating one another." Jesse nodded like he'd been there.\n\n
"So, what research do you have? Other than the cure formula Mr. McVillain tainted with his damned Omegavirus."
# grey out ones we do not have. Disable them after we chose them, after we chose all available show 4
vanJesse_outcome1_option1= Dr. Agbayani's CDC research
vanJesse_outcome1_option2= European research from the Government's computers
vanJesse_outcome1_option3= A vial of monkey blood from Dr. van Nooten
# hide this option until the three above are all hidden or disabled (seen)
vanJesse_outcome1_option4= That's it
vanJesse_outcome1_outcome1= "Right, right, Rufus' dad, the CDC researcher." Jesse nodded. "I wonder if the kid ever forgave his old man for being away so much."
vanJesse_outcome1_outcome2= "Hah!" Jesse laughed. "I wonder if old Senator Davis realizes you stole that data from right out under her crooked nose. Might be the key to wrecking all her plans of world domination and zombie super soldiers and such."
vanJesse_outcome1_outcome3= "The original tained blood." Jesse was nearly reverent. "What I wouldn't give to go back in time to that moment and stop it all from happening. I'd have killed poor Doc van Nooten before she spread her disease to half the world and doomed everything."
# you have all 3 - move on to the story
vanJesse_story= Jesse nodded excitedly. "We've got everything we need! Now for my story."\n\n
"After I left you, I travelled east to the Okanagan desert. I lay in the sun day and night until I met my spirit animal. A great snake, thirty feet long and covered in feathers, curled itself around my body. It whispered in my ear for days, telling me the secrets of the desert, of the rythm of life and death."\n\n
"Then I woke, and the snake had become a woman with long grey hair. She brought me to her home in a trailer park and fed me tea that made me tingle with energy from foot to noggin."
# you are missing a piece - fail and end
vanJesse_outcome1_outcome4_fail= "Damn it all! That's not nearly enough to work. I wish there was some way you could go back and find the pieces we need, but it's too late... too late."\n\n
"Guess I'll have to look someplace else. Somewhere far from [CityName]. This town has doom written all over it in ten foot tall letters."\n\n
As Jesse turned to go, he tipped his hat at me once again. "Whatever you decide to do, pardner, I'll tell your story."
vanJesse_story_option1= Keep Listening...
vanJesse_story_outcome1= "I felt my heart beat for the first time in years. Just a few sluggish ka-thuds, but it was something!"\n\n
"She told me the tea was made from a purple bush that grows only in that desert. The First Nations people used it in healing rituals and to induce visions. It changed me. I could finally think clearly since I'd been bitten. I felt almost human again!"\n\n
"I think this purple plant counteracts the disease somehow."
vanJesse_story_outcome1_option1= Offer to study the plant
vanJesse_story_outcome1_outcome1= He tossed the dusty duffel bag into my arms. "I brought back all I could carry. Get your researchers to study it, figure out how to concentrate it, then test it out on some zombies. I reckon it might even have an effect on that Omegavirus of yours."\n\n
"I'll be around." Jesse smiled. "This town is sure going to hell in a handbasket, but I reckon it's not too late to turn things around."
vanJesse_story_outcome1_outcome1_effect= Mission available to study the purple plant
vanJesse_outcome2= This is the last time I hope I'll ever have to deal with that zombie halfbreed. I swear, I'll destroy this entire city before I hear that idiotic cowboy out.

vanStudyFinish= We... We've done it. We successfully inserted an enzyme from that purple flower into the Omegavirus-tainted vaccine. The original monkey blood gave us the key delivery mechanism, but we could never have figured it out without all that research we'd collected.\n\n
This new vaccine doesn't just kill the virus, it restores the immune system and reboots the circulatory and nervous systems. It reverses damage caused by the virus and might... it might actually make us all human again.
vanStudyFinish_option1= Take the vaccine yourself first
vanStudyFinish_option2= Test in on Jesse first
vanStudyFinish_outcome1_pictureColin= true
vanStudyFinish_outcome1= I injected the new cure and spent an anxious night in a quarantine room. I thought about all the people who'd gotten me to this point. Diane. [Name2].\n\n
The next morning, I woke feeling better than I had in months. My cheeks are flushed with blood, the capillaries repairing. The red film of rage that has rested at the edge of my consciousness is subsiding. I feel sane again! I feel human again!
vanStudyFinish_outcome1_option1= Give it to Jesse next
vanStudyFinish_jesse_picture= jail
vanStudyFinish_jesse_pictureColin= rotten
vanStudyFinish_jesse= Jesse agreed to take an injection and spend the night in our quarantine cell. I waited with him and listened to his tales of cowboys and the wild west.\n\n
After midnight, he grew feverish and stopped talking. He wrapped himself in a blanket and rocked back and forth. I waited.\n\n
"I'm n-not a real cowboy." he stuttered. "I w-was a salesman. I s-sold vacuum cleaners."

Jesse sure looks cured alright. His face is pinker than a blushing pig. Oh hell, now I'm doing it.\n\n
We finally have a _real_ cure - not just to prevent the zombie disease, but to reverse its effects. It seems like magic... just days ago I thought we were all doomed. But we did it.

As for the zombies... the cure works on them too, the ones that still have all their major organs anyway. We're working on a program to capture, cure and heal the least wounded ones.\n\n
Time to finish cleaning up this city. The Government is still at war with us. Should we finish them, or try to declare a cease-fire?

"I think it's time we put this war to an end." she said. "We have a common goal after all; distributing that new cure of yours. I hear you've finally worked out the kinks."\n\n
A pretty snide comment considering she might have been responsible for putting those kinks there in the first place.
vanGovernmentPeace_option1= Negotiate peace
vanGovernmentPeace_option2= Fight them to the end
vanGovernmentPeace_outcome1= I swallowed my pride and told the Senator that we would stop our attacks if the Government does the same. She agreed.\n\n
After hours of paperwork detailing the conditions of our cease-fire, I still don't know about these guys. Were they just opportunists who saw the Omegavirus as a way to stronger, better soldiers? Or had they created the disease in the first place and used that McManager Clark as a pawn? We'll never know...
vanGovernmentPeace_outcome2= Hehe... now we're talking. I don't think quite _all_ of the Omegavirus bloodlust has left my veins yet!

Blow the whole city up.\n
Blow... the whole city... up.\n\n
And take the Omegavirus with it.
vanNuke_option1= Arm the warhead
vanNuke_outcome1_pictureColin2= [FactionLeader]
vanNuke_outcome1= The thing was live and connected to a detonator. We hacked it (literally, with a hacksaw) and bypassed its security just as Senator Davis stormed in.\n\n
"Get away from there!" she shouted. "Do you have any idea what that is!?"\n\n
I calmly told her I knew exactly what it was and her tone changed to pleading. "Listen, you don't want to detonate that. It would kill you too."\n\n
"Come with us instead. Join our ranks as a General, and we'll conquer this great land from sea to shining sea."
vanNuke_outcome1_option1= Blow it up
vanNuke_outcome1_option2= Surrender to the Government
vanNuke_outcome1_outcome1= I hit the detonator and Davis screamed -

vanNuke_outcome1_outcome2= I let Governments soldiers shackle my wrists and lead me away.\n\n

Since we've cured the Omegavirus and have no reason to ever want to use such a terrible weapon, we did our best to permanently disarm it, then barricaded the silo entrance with poured cement.

winTypeRepublic= Survivors are already campaigning for senate seats, but we're limiting the time and resources they can spend on their campaigns so they still get some actual work done. Elections will be held by single transferable vote.
winTypeDemocracy= Power to the people! No law will be passed, no decision made in our true democracy without a vote by the people of [CityName]. Even deciding Bubble-Frost-Tea flavors. Vote for Chocolate - it's Choco-Great!
winTypeTheocratic= Our code of laws will follow religion's moral code. The church will have special power in the new government, and will exercise God's will in our glorious new nation. Thus his light will be upon us.
winTypeCapitalist= The market is never wrong. It may be unrelenting, uncaring and remorseless, but it is a principle so pure it cannot be faulted. Supply and demand. Yin and Yang. The universe in balance.
winTypeCommunist= Relentless greed and capitalism will find no ground in our nation of equals, comrades. The class system is shattered. There will be no rich people or poor people or important or neglected people... only people.
winTypeSocialist= We will raise up the downtrodden. To life, liberty, and justice we're adding free education, health care, and comfortable retirement. If any of us makes it to retirement age, that is.
winTypeFascist= The government will take an iron hand in overseeing its people, and we will do whatever necessary to protect and uphold our new nation's dominance over [CityName].
winTypeMilitary= Every man, woman and child will know how to cock a rifle and aim for the head. Those who choose to guard our lives with theirs will be revered as heroes. And if any outsider threatens our dominance over [CityName], we will answer with war.

And now, onward! There are more survivors out there and other cities that need our help!
winLeaveContinue_option1= Leave
# if we are leaving someone in charge behind us
winLeave_leader= We said our farewells at the gate.\n\n
The new leader, [Name2], promised to take good care of [CityName]. [He2] said we'd always be welcome back... but I knew I'd never return.
# if we are leaving nobody behind
winLeave_nobody= We shut the gates but left no one behind us.

# When you complete the mission to investigate the Rotten's subway
investigateRotten_title= Subway Investigation
investigateRotten_picture= rotten
investigateRotten_pictureColin= rotten
investigateRotten= [We] [were] picking [our] way through the rubble at the subway entrance when there was a click at my back and a voice said "If you're looking for trouble, friend, I'll accommodate ya."\n\n
I turned around slowly... and nearly crapped myself. It was a zombie! A zombie pointing a revolver at me and grinning.\n\n
"Hold on there pardner," he said in an obviously fake John Wayne drawl, "this here's our spread, an' yer trespassin' on it". He was dressed the part in a trenchcoat and cowboy hat. A talking freaking zombie in a cowboy hat.
investigateRotten_option1= Wait in stunned silence...
investigateRotten_outcome1= Other zombies started shambling up all around us, but they weren't attacking, just kind of watching us and this crazy Clint Eastwood wannabe.\n\n
"They call us the Rotten," he tipped his hat with his pistol. "My name's Jesse. We won't be wronged. We won't be insulted. We won't be laid a hand on. We don't do these things to other people and we require the same from them. Now get off our land." He gestured at me with his gun.\n\n
I was getting nervous about the gathering ghouls, when one of them who'd come up from behind suddenly laid a hand on my shoulder.
investigateRotten_outcome1_option1= Flip out and start shooting
investigateRotten_outcome1_outcome1= [We] shot up those zombies good, until [we] saw they were screaming and covering their faces with their hands, like innocent people attacked by strangers who broke into their home and... uh-oh.\n\n
Then the ones with weapons got mad. They charged [us], swinging metal pipes and clubs and hurling pieces of subway turnstiles. They yelled obscenities in a very un-zombielike way. [We] beat a retreat.\n\n
The last thing [we] heard as [we] ran out of there was Jesse cursing us. I think we've made an enemy.
investigateRotten_outcome1_option2= Try to talk to them
investigateRotten_outcome1_outcome2= They were wary of us, but some told their stories. They'd been bitten by regular zed, got the fever, and fell asleep for what they thought was the last time... then woke up. They were dead, yet still themselves.\n\n
Mostly. Some of these creatures are pretty brain damaged. Their speech is slurred, they move sluggishly, they're easily confused. Jesse's clearly a few horses short of a rodeo. And they're prone to mood swings. One of them nearly bit my head off - literally - when I called him a zombie. I'm not comfortable with these... whatever they are... living so close to us, but we may have no choice.
investigateRotten_outcome1_option3= Leave peacefully
investigateRotten_outcome1_outcome3= The strange zombies, or whatever they are, were relieved when [we] left. A toothless man with one arm spat on the ground behind [us] to say "good riddance".\n\n
Jesse followed to make sure [we] [were] really going. "Listen pardner," he said, "I'll give you some advice: never kick a cow patty on a hot day."\n\n
He nodded meaningfully, like I had any clue what he meant.


# When you return to the rotten in later scenarios
# We assume you met them the first time
investigateRottenAgain_title= Subway Investigation
investigateRottenAgain_picture= rotten
investigateRottenAgain_pictureColin= rotten
investigateRottenAgain= [We] made our way through makeshift defenses, basically anything heavy that could be piled up in front of the subway entrance.\n\n
A figure in a long trenchcoat appeared at the bottom of the stairs.\n\n
"Howdy [p|friend|friends]." he spoke through his teeth, a cigar in the corner of his mouth. "I've been wondering when you would show."\n\n
It was Jesse, leader of the Rotten. Not quite dead, not quite right in the head...
investigateRottenAgain_option1= Greet him
investigateRottenAgain_option2= Flip out and start shooting
investigateRottenAgain_outcome1= Jesse relaxed and took his hands out of his coat pockets. I realized he'd had a pistol pointed at [us] until now.\n\n
"So, you're setting up in [CityName] too," he said. "Hope you aren't fixing to start any trouble in these parts."\n\n
He gave me a good long look in the eyes then nodded. "We Rotten have staked our claim on everything under the streets, and have the means to defend it if pressed. You stay clear and we won't have any trouble."
investigateRottenAgain_outcome2= Before [we] could even draw, Jesse was raining bullets at [us] from his dual pistols. He must have had them pointed [our] way from under his coat.\n\n
The other Rotten poured out of the subway and forced [us] back out to the street. [We] retreated.\n\n
We've made an enemy.
