mobSpotted_title= Zombie Mob Spotted!
mobSpotted_picture= zombiesBored
mobSpotted_pictureColin= false
mobSpotted_1= Uh-oh, we've spotted a huge mob of zombies coming our way. {1} of them at least, huge and angry looking beasts. They're moving in a group like a river of undead.\n\n
Not sure they even know we're here yet, but at the pace they're shuffling they'll reach our walls in {2} days.
mobSpotted_2= There's something moving out there in the city, something big. Looks like a mob of {1} or more zombies are on the move, shuffling our way.\n\n
I'd estimate they're going to reach us in about {2} days. We better be ready for them when they do.
mobSpotted_3= Usually zombies mass gradually beside our walls, but this group is different. They're on the move, a horde of maybe {1} of them, flowing through the city slowly but inexorably in our direction.\n\n
We'll probably have to fight them in {2} days, and it's going to be much worse than a regular attack.

# warning that mob ran over a mission and cancelled it
mobCancelledMission_title= {1} cancelled by Mob
mobCancelledMission_picture= zombiesAngry
mobCancelledMission_pictureColin= false
mobCancelledMission_1= We were out [missioning] at [a] [square] when the place started filling up with zed, fast. We had to get the hell out of there while we still could. Better watch out for that mob of undead, they seem to be headed for our fort.
mobCancelledMissionInjury_1= A huge horde of mindless undead are stampeding towards our fort. Well, shuffling very quickly. [FormalName] was out [missioning] directly in their path. [He] was nearly killed... [he] lost a good jacket and nearly lost the arm in it too when they tried to gnaw it off.
mobCancelledMissionInjury_2= How many times have I heard the words "lucky to be alive" this week. Four? Five? [FormalName] joined the ranks of such lucky people after [missioning] directly in the path of an oncoming zombie horde. The mob completely filled the [square] as it passed through, and [Name] only survived by hiding in a parked car for hours, breathing very shallowly and trying not to smell too human.\n\n
The sheer terror of it really shook [him] up, so I put [him] on sick leave for a few days.

# warning when mob just moved beside the fort and will attack in a day
mobBesideFort_title= Zombie Mob Attack Imminent!

# roamer attack
zombieAttackSupermob_title= Attacked by roamers!
zombieAttackSupermob_picture= zombiesSuper
zombieAttackSupermob_pictureColin= false
zombieAttackSupermob_1= Something's different about this group of zombies at the [square]. They seem smarter... not like people though, it's an animal cunning, like wolves hunting in a pack. They don't go straight for us, but kind of circle around, looking for easier targets.\n\n
They nearly cornered [FormalName] who was [missioning] there. We had to cancel that from now, it's far too dangerous right now.
zombieAttackSupermob_2= These roaming zombie packs are more dangerous simply from their unpredictability. Like the ghosts from Pac-Man, some of them go straight for you, while others circle around and try to get you from behind. Some of them seem to move randomly, changing targets or even seeming to get bored in the middle of an attack.\n\n
We had to stop [missioning] at the [square]; it's far too dangerous to be around these things.
zombieAttackSupermob_3= Zed with weapons... it's a scary thought. Good thing they haven't gotten past the "Thag smash with big stick" stage yet, and on to techniques like throwing and pulling triggers.\n\n
We saw a group of these stick-wielding zombies heading to the [square] and booked it. [Missioning] will have to wait until later.
zombieAttackSupermobInjury_1= [FormalName] was overrun by a horde of zombies while [missioning] at a [square]. They were exhibiting signs of mild intelligence... for zombies that is. Rather than go straight for the noisest target, they went for the most vulnerable one. Today, that was [Name].\n\n
[He]'s lucky to be alive and unbitten, but [he] had to dive into a freezing cold pond to escape them. [He]'s now recovering from hypothermia and is pretty rattled. [He]'ll need a couple days before [he]'ll go out there again.
zombieAttackSupermobInjury_2= These roaming zed seem to know how to use weapons... sort of. They can bash things with rocks or pieces of wood anyway, which is what happened to [Name] when they caught [him] out [missioning].\n\n
The only reason [he]'s still alive is that they didn't bite [him] instead.
zombieAttackSupermobDeath_picture= grave
zombieAttackSupermobDeath_pictureColin= false
zombieAttackSupermobDeath= A group of roaming zed must have caught wind of [FormalName] while [he] was out [missioning] in their area. These things are sneakier than your average zombie, and they managed to surround [him] on all sides before they pounced.\n\n
One of them nearly chewed [his] arm off before [he] got out of there and made it back to the fort. We managed to staunch the flow of blood in time to save [his] arm, but [he] was infected. The fever took [him] almost immediately... [he] was dead by sundown.
zombieAttackSupermobDeathImmune= A group of roaming zed must have caught wind of [FormalName] while [he] was out [missioning] in their area. These things are sneakier than your average zombie, and they managed to surround [him] on all sides before they pounced.\n\n
One of them nearly chewed [his] arm off before [he] got out of there and made it back to the fort. We managed to staunch the flow of blood in time to save [his] arm, though [he] was so riddled with bite marks [he] should surely have been infected.\n\n
Somehow, [he] survived.

# DEFAULT NO-OP COMBAT EVENTS
######################################


# Easy Win - They had no chance of making it through our defenses. Automatic win. No choice.
combatEasyWinZed_1= The one good thing 'bout the zed is that they're predictable. They attacked our [square] today and we just [funneled them all into a large pit full of sharp sticks|let them through piano wire strung at neck-height] and let them do the rest. All we had to do was pick off a few stragglers.
combatEasyWinZed_2= The zed's numbers are no match for humanity's [*discipline|resolve|passion]. We met them head-on and [*tore them to shreds with our gunfire|sliced them into so many pieces, we made a kind of zombie-slurry|used our improvised pikes to make a set of zombie shish-kabobs].
combatEasyWinZed_3= I need to thank whoever's idea it was to [*cover our walls with old saw blades|dig that small moat around the fort|fill the outside roads full of barbed-wire tumbleweeds].  The zed attacked today and took care of themselves with almost no help from us.
combatEasyWinZed_4= The zed aren't smart and they don't run from danger. Even when [*you've got a sniper on the nearby building, picking them off one by one|you make a convenient head-sized hole in your wall, complete with guillotine attachment|each one that steps out of the shadows ends up with a flaming arrow in it's chest] they keep coming, and dying, until there are none left.
combatEasyWinZed_5= I know we're supposed to be scared of them, but it's a little hard when zombies [*keep tripping over themselves like that|keep falling into the same traps over and over]. I almost didn't have the heart to shoot them. Almost.
combatEasyWinZed_6= You know we're having an easy time defending the fort when you're coming up with little songs during the fight: "[Three little zombies, all in a row. _Pop_ goes their heads, and down they go!|Fire in our eyes! Fire in our heads! But most important, fire at the zed!|Take off their heads and destroy their brains! This is the only way we'll stay sane!]"
combatEasyWinZed_7= I don't know that I'll ever get used to these zombie attacks, but it's good to know we're beating back the [*brain eaters|shovel-heads|dead and toothy] without too much trouble. For the moment at least.
combatEasyWinZed_8= [*The sun is shining, the birds are singing and|It's going to take ages to get the rotten flesh stains out of my shirt but] we've got a whole bunch less zed to worry about.
combatEasyWinZed_9= No sweat. Did you know [*the zed|the undead|zombies] can't swim? On a related note, we've got a swimming pool we need to empty now.
combatEasyWinZed_10= They swarmed just after 2am, not ten minutes after I'd finally been able to get to sleep. But I was up and out there within 5 minutes just like we drilled, and by dawn all that was left of them were a pile of bloody body parts.

# automatic win against faction attack or raiders. No choice.
combatEasyWinFaction_1= [Faction] just tried to attack our [square]! We were a little worried at first, but turns out they didn't stand a chance against our defenses. We [*threw insults and rude gestures at them from behind the safety of our walls|made a game of who could get the most headshots|better clean up their remains soon or they'll start to stink up the fort].
combatEasyWinFaction_2= [Faction] {2}ed our [square] earlier today. Fortunately, [*we were already there, lying in wait|we had rigged the place with a boggling array rube-goldberg-like traps|the soldiers they brought were all fairly green]. We beat them easily.
combatEasyWinFaction_3= We had to fight off [faction] today. I don't like to kill living people, but so long as they keep [*shooting at our wall watchers|trying sabotage our [square]|stealing our stuff] we will show them no mercy!
combatEasyWinFaction_4= [Faction] are a tough bunch, but today we were tougher. They attacked our [square] and we [*met them in hand-to-hand combat and kicked their butts. Literally|pinned them down with a hail of gunfire, and picked off any who tried who poked their heads out|just let them beat on our walls ineffectively for a couple of hours. Eventually they gave up in disgust and wandered off].
combatEasyWinFaction_5= In a harsh world like this, I like our big walls. It means when neighbors like [faction] come [*knocking to demand tribute|looking to start a fight|knocking with mischief on their minds], we can just leave them out there until the zed scare them off.
combatEasyWinFaction_6= We told [faction] it was a bad idea to attack us, but they came after our [square]. A few hours later, all they have to show for it are [*a few extra bullet holes in our walls and a lot less ammo in their pockets|the black eyes and bruises of a good solid thrashing|a few broken bones and a few less people].
combatEasyWinFaction_7= I think [faction] were hoping we wouldn't fight back. Last night they found out the hard way that we aren't going to roll over and take it anymore. Not from the zed, and not from them.
combatEasyWinFaction_8= I think [faction] were [trying to be sneaky|just scouting the area|trying to scare us], but [painting yourself green in an urban environment doesn't really work|we took them out just to be on the safe side|their zombie disguises weren't very good].\n\n
We took care of them without even breaking a nail.
combatEasyWinFaction_9= Well, that didn't go well for [faction]. I just hope they don't come around asking for [restitution|medical supplies|forgiveness] anytime soon. They'll find us [plumb out|not the best trade partners|lacking in that department] if they do.
combatEasyWinFaction_10= [Faction] seems to think if they just believe hard enough, they'll beat us. It doesn't work like that in real life, and today we had to shatter their dreams.

# Undefended loss - We didn't see them coming, they took the square. No choice & no extra loss snippet.
combatUndefendedLossZed_1= The Zed just hit our [square]. I knew we should have had someone posted by that wall. [*They seemed almost sad when they didn't find anyone there|No one heard them tearing through our barricades until it was too late|Still, I suppose we should be thankful no one was there to get hurt].
combatUndefendedLossZed_2= Maybe if we'd had someone near our [square] the zed wouldn't have taken us by surprise. And then maybe [*we'd still have a wall to defend|we could have at least killed a few of them].
combatUndefendedLossZed_3= [*Those undead can be awful sneaky when they want to be|I never thought I'd get snuck up on by a shuffling corpse|Last thing you need when waking up in the morning is a zed's ugly mug a few inches away from your face]. By the time we realized the zed were hitting our [square], it was already too late. Probably would have helped if we had some sort of guards in the area.
combatUndefendedLossZed_4= Uninvited guests are never fun, especially when [*they show up during dinner|they keep leaving decomposing body parts all over the place|you weren't expecting them]. Maybe we could have kept the zed out of our [square] if we'd had guards in the area, but it's too late now.
combatUndefendedLossZed_5= At first I was going to complain that our guards were [*asleep at their posts|off canoodling with one another] but then I realized we didn't have any guards posted by our [square]. I know we're shorthanded but if we're going to keep the undead out of our fort we need to pay attention to defense.
combatUndefendedLossZed_6= I'm not sure guards would have helped against the horde of zed that barreled through our [square] but [*they couldn't have made things worse|at least they would have given us some warning|if we're going to lose a building to the zed, I'd like to know about it in advance].

# faction tore the walls down with no defenders. No choice & no extra loss snippet.
combatUndefendedLossFactionAttack_1= Maybe if we'd had guards posted near our [square], we might have talked the [FactionNoThe] out of storming it. On the other hand, our people might have just ended up [*getting tarred and feathered|forcibly "recruited" into their ranks|gunned down like dogs].\n\n
Since they couldn't find anybody to hurt, [faction] instead dismantled our walls and let the zed in to the [square].
combatUndefendedLossFactionAttack_2= I knew we should have posted more guards. Sure, they might have ended up [*covered in holes and set on fire|torn to shreds and stomped all over|gutted and left for the zed] just like the rest of the [square], but there's a chance they could have made a difference.\n\n
[Faction] made a real mess of the [square] before they opened the gates and let the zombies back in. All our work, undone.
combatUndefendedLossFactionAttack_3= It doesn't matter how many fancy traps or alarm systems we come up with if no one's there to hear them. [Faction] attacked our [square] and no one heard [*those windchimes we'd attached to the trip wires|the sound of the wall caving in on itself] until it was too late.
combatUndefendedLossFactionAttack_4= With society gone, us survivors have to fight for every scrap we've got. The [factionAdjective] attack on our [square] was [*just another part of that|another grim reminder of how alone we really are|the latest breakdown in communication between our two factions].\n\n
I wish we'd at least had somebody there to defend against them. Instead they just walked right in and tore down our walls.

# faction raided us with no defenders. No choice & no extra loss snippet.
# {3} what they stole
combatUndefendedLossFactionRaid_1= With the tensions so high between us and [faction], we should have had somebody on watch when that group of raiders approached. They got everything that wasn't nailed down in the [square], including [that 30 year old whisky I was saving|my collection of vintage 80's action figures].
combatUndefendedLossFactionRaid_2= We really should have had someone on watch. The last thing we need is to paint a large "No one here, free for plundering" sign on our fort. The [factionAdjective] raiders must have been so excited when they showed up to find nobody protecting the [square] at all.
combatUndefendedLossFactionRaid_3= [Faction] just raided our [square]. I know we didn't have anyone to defend it but it was poor form of them to [*cover the buildings in rotten eggs and toilet paper|leave that "Sorry we missed you" note]. Talk about adding insult to injury.
combatUndefendedLossFactionRaid_4= Damn [faction]. They attacked our [square] yesterday while everyone was busy somewhere else. I say we should go looking for revenge, but we need to clean this place up first and replace what they stole.

combatNoopZed_2= They're in a frenzy at the wall by our [square].
combatNoopZed_3= The [square] wall isn't going to hold, we have to do something!
combatNoopZed_4= Massed zed found a way through our wall. They're attacking!
combatNoopZed_5= We can't hold them off for long. We need a plan!
combatNoopZed_6= They'll be through any minute now!
combatNoopZed_option= Let our defenders handle it
combatNoopZed_option1_2= Proceed as usual
combatNoopZed_outcome_success_1= It was a rough fight, but they were no match for our [*pluck|muscle|moxy|might|brains]. Having [*a wall between us and them|them charge our gun placements|all that barbed wire for them to climb through] didn't hurt either.
combatNoopZed_outcome_success_2= I wasn't sure we were going to win that one but [it looks like God (or whatever probability influencing deity and/or event you prefer) was smiling on us|if they're going to come at us one at a time like that, I'm not complaining|we made it through the day by the skin of our teeth].
combatNoopZed_outcome_success_3= We won! Sure, things looked bad when [*that giant zed came barreling through both our forces|that pack of rabid dogs joined in on the attack|gas main exploded] but we used the chaos to our advantage and kicked the lot of them out of our fort.
combatNoopZed_outcome_fail_1= It's a [*violent|bad|ugly|dangerous] world out there and nothing pushes that fact home like [*getting your teeth kicked in|being trapped between the zed and all those angry gangs looking for blood|spending the whole day fighting on an empty belly, only to lose].
combatNoopZed_outcome_fail_2= We gave it our best shot, but [*we lost. And lost hard|sometimes you've got to know when to run|luck wasn't on our side].
combatNoopZed_outcome_fail_3= That was bad [. I thought we could take them, but it looks like I was sorely mistaken.|but I suppose it could have been worse. Not a lot worse, mind, but worse|. We'll try harder next time. Assuming we survive that long.]

# {2} = attack or raid
combatNoopFaction_1= [Faction] are {2}ing our [square]!
combatNoopFaction_2= I don't think [faction] are here to talk.
combatNoopFaction_3= The [factionNoThe] are coming! The [factionNoThe] are coming!
combatNoopFaction_4= [factionAdjective] thugs are on us! They're {2}ing!
combatNoopFaction_5= Quick, we need to fortify the [square]! [Faction] is {2}ing us.
combatNoopFaction_option= Let our defenders handle it

combatNoopFaction_outcome_success_1= It was a rough fight, but they were no match for our [*pluck|muscle|moxy|might|brains]. Having [*a wall between us and them|them charge our gun placements|all that barbed wire for them to climb through] didn't hurt either.
combatNoopFaction_outcome_success_2= They smashed through the gate screaming and shooting like some post-apocalyptic Mad Max gang. But their enthusiasm was no match for our having an actual strategy. We outmaneuvered them easily.
combatNoopFaction_outcome_success_3= The [factionAdjective] {2}ers made so much noise on their approach that we were ready for them long before they reached the walls. They barely even scratched the paint.
combatNoopFaction_outcome_success_4= We beat [Faction] easily. I'll bet they learned a thing or two from our flawless defense, but it won't do them much good since they're all dead.
combatNoopFaction_outcome_success_5= The [factionAdjective] morons couldn't have picked a worse place to attack our fort. That [square] was so well defended a cockroach would have had trouble getting through it. We beat them easily.

combatNoopFaction_outcome_fail_1= It's a [*violent|bad|ugly|dangerous] world out there and nothing pushes that fact home like [*getting your teeth kicked in|being trapped between the zed and all those angry gangs looking for blood|spending the whole day fighting on an empty belly, only to lose].
combatNoopFaction_outcome_fail_2= We were outnumbered from the start... I'll bet tomorrow's rations some were hired mercenaries. We did our best to hold them off, but were forced to retreat.
combatNoopFaction_outcome_fail_3= When the attack hit, we were busy dealing with an angry group of zed on the other side of the fort... which in retrospect was probably a distraction by [Faction]. Unfortunately, we lost.
combatNoopFaction_outcome_fail_4= Those [factionAdjective] meatheads dug under the walls and popped up like gophers right behind our guards. It was a brief fight... and we lost.


######################################
# GENERAL COMBAT EVENTS
######################################

# Get Out of There! - Pull people out of area. Increased danger, no injury/death.
combatRetreat= We could order everyone to retreat. We'd be more likely to lose the building, but at least nobody'd get hurt.
combatRetreat_option= Order everyone to retreat
combatRetreat_outcome_success= Even without defenders, our walls held. I don't know that we can count on the same sort of luck next time.
combatRetreat_outcome_fail= Without anyone left to guard the area it quickly fell to the {1}.


# Give it Your All! - Put survivors in risky positions. Increased danger, only injury/death on loss.
combatProtectStuff= We could take risks to defend the building. Somebody may get hurt, but our walls and supplies are worth the added danger.
combatProtectStuff_option= Take risks to protect the building
combatProtectStuff_outcome_success= The {1} broke on us like waves hitting a particularly solid chunk of granite.
combatProtectStuff_outcome_fail= Sometimes you bend, and sometimes you break. This time we broke.


# How Much? - Offer to give them a portion of the resources they would steal. Zero danger, pay 50% of raid goods.
combatBribe= We could bribe them. It'll cost us... but not as much as losing this fight could.
combatBribe_option= Bribe [faction]
combatBribe_outcome_success= [Faction] seemed satisfied with our meager offerings. They called it a "friendship tax". I call it extortion. At least once they're out of earshot.
combatBribe_outcome_fail= Whaaa? combatBribe_outcome_fail?


# Last Line of Defense - Reduced danger, always death on loss.
combatToTheDeath= We could defend these walls to our dying breaths. They'd have a hard time making it past us, and would have to do it over our dead bodies.
combatToTheDeath_option= Defend to our dying breaths
combatToTheDeath_outcome_success= We dug in our heels and became a wall of meat and resolve. Not a single attacker made it past us.
combatToTheDeath_outcome_fail= Our defenders gave it every last drop of blood, sweat and tears they had... but we still lost.


# Call for Help (General) - If a faction likes you enough, you can ask them to help you. Results in loss of respect either way. Bonus is smaller than the "Friend of X" perk version.
# {3} = faction short name
combatFactionHelp= Some people from {3} happen to be visiting and they owe us a favor. We could ask them to help.
combatFactionHelp_option= Ask {3} for help
combatFactionHelp_outcome_success= Trapped between us and {3}, the {1} didn't stand a chance. They lost a little respect for us not being able to defend our own walls.
combatFactionHelp_outcome_fail= Even with help from our friends, there were just too many. One of {3}, a [thin woman with a scar on her eyebrow|wiry guy with more guts than brains|loudmouthed girl who wouldn't take orders] was killed, and they're pretty upset about it.


# Mercenaries - Hire Gustav's mercs. More expensive "Price of Friendship" perk version.
combatGustavHelp= A couple of Gustav's mercenaries were nearby and came running. They'll help us out... but it's going to cost us.
combatGustavHelp_option= Hire Mercenaries
combatGustavHelp_outcome_success= Gustav's mercenaries made short work of the {1} and we paid them well. It's a little suspicious that they happened to be there at just the right time... but let's just be thankful that we're all alive and safe.
combatGustavHelp_outcome_fail= Gustav's men did what they could, but it wasn't enough. We still had to pay them for their effort.


# Lock and Load - Spend X ammo to gain bonus.
combatExtraAmmo= We could tell our guys to fire at anything that moves. We'll use up ammo faster but more shots means more hits.
combatExtraAmmo_option= Use extra ammo
combatExtraAmmo_outcome_success= Our ammo stores are a bit lighter but given all the extra holes we put in the {1}, I'm not complaining.
combatExtraAmmo_outcome_fail= The {1} ducked and weaved like gazelles, dodging our bullets. Even with our extra firepower they still overran us.


# Meat, Glorious Meat - Attack\tThrow X food at zombies to distract and gain bonus.
combatThrowMeat= We could try distracting the zed with some of our food stores. Meat is meat after all.
combatThrowMeat_option= Distract with food
combatThrowMeat_outcome_success= We threw [20 pounds of dog food|half a deer carcass|a case of beef jerky] over the wall at those ravenous zed. I'm sure they'd have rather gnawed on our skulls, but were curious enough to investigate. It was enough of a distraction to let us take them out.
combatThrowMeat_outcome_fail= Those zed sure can eat fast. They devoured the food within minutes then came for us.


# Light 'em Up! - Spend X fuel to set the attackers on fire and gain bonus.
combatFire= We could set off some of our fuel reserves. Nobody likes running through fire, human or zed.
combatFire_option= Light up our fuel
combatFire_outcome_success= Our wall of flame worked like a charm. Of course, now the whole fort smells like burnt sausages.
combatFire_outcome_fail= As the {1} fell to the flames, the ones behind them simply used their comrades' burning bodies as stepping stones. How are we supposed to deal with that?


# Barricade the Doors! - Spend X building materials to build barricade.
combatBarricade= There's a lot of junk around here. We could use our spare building materials to setup a quick barricade.
combatBarricade_option= Build a barricade
combatBarricade_outcome_success= With enough duct tape and rusty nails, anything can be a barrier. They tore it all to shreds, but it gave us enough time to get around for a better angle behind them.
combatBarricade_outcome_fail= The {1} punched straight through our crude walls like they were made of packing peanuts. To be fair, the styrofoam was probably a poor choice of material to use.


# Bandages for Everyone! - Make this a choice between a specific survivor's health and pressing the fight. John's been shot but he wants to keep fighting! Should we pull him back & heal instead? (slightly lower danger and any death switches to john being injured)
combatMedicine= [FormalName] got clipped in the first wave. We could patch [him] up with some meds to make sure nobody dies this time.
combatMedicine_option= Heal [Name] using medicine
combatMedicine_outcome_success= We gave [Name] some pills that I'm pretty sure were painkillers, and bound [his] arm in a splint. [He] used [his] bandaged arm as a club to beat the {1} senseless, then said [he] felt better than [he] had in years and went right back to work. Those must have been some good pills, whatever they were.
combatMedicine_outcome_fail= Those bandages stopped the bleeding in time, so at least [Name] is still alive. Sure, [he] might wish [he] was dead right now, but that's not [his] call to make.


# Bang! - Spend X fireworks to distract zombies.
combatFireworks= We could light off some of our fireworks. You never know, it might distract them.
combatFireworks_option= Light off fireworks
combatFireworks_outcome_success= The zombies seemed to be completely in awe, slack-jawed and staring up at the explosions in the sky, and didn't see us coming. Was it childlike wonder, or just random neurons firing in response to an intense stimulous? Is there a difference?
combatFireworks_outcome_fail= The zed were unimpressed with our [*green|red|pink] sparklers this time. I thought at least the [*flying spinners|roman candles|poppers] would get them to pause, but they were too focused on the smell of living meat.


# Boom! - Use bomb to blow attackers up. Zero danger, square is reduced to rubble.
combatBombRubble= They're right over an explosives cache. We could blow it up, but we'd destroy our [square] in the process.
combatBombRubble_option= Blow the explosives up
combatBombRubble_outcome_success= All that remains of the {1} (and the building they were attacking) is a smoldering crater.
combatBombRubble_outcome_fail= Whaaa?? combatBombRubble_outcome_fail?


# Snap Trap - Lay down X quick traps to slow attackers. Minor bonus.
combatTrap= We've got some zombie traps nearby, maybe we could use them to slow down the attackers.
combatTrap_option= Use our zombie traps
combatTrap_outcome_success= They were simple traps, but even a board with a nail through it will slow someone down when they step on it. It gave us the edge we needed.
combatTrap_outcome_fail= I knew we should have planted the traps further to the [*east|west]. The {1} ran right past them.


# Can spend Bath Salts to go apeshit but causes addict either way. Might only be one guy.
combatBathSalts= [FormalName] already snorted the usual dose of Bath Salts, but [he] wants more.
combatBathSalts_option= Give [Name] more Bath Salts
combatBathSalts_outcome_success= [Name] took a second hit of the salts and grinned like a madman, [his] eyes wide and bloodshot and pupils constricted to points. When [he] returned half an hour later [he] was covered head to toe with blood, but luckily none of it was [hiss].\n\n
Now [he] can't wait to take more of the stuff.
combatBathSalts_outcome_fail= I knew something was wrong the moment [Name] too [his] second hit. [He] wasn't just fearless; [he] was reckless. We were probably going to lose anyway, but [Name's] charging in before it was safe didn't help. Despite that, [he] came out alive and can't wait to get [his] next dose of the stuff.

# PERK COMBAT EVENTS
######################################

# {1} = {subject_factionAttack} etc ([FactionNoThe] or zombies)
# {2} = {action_factionAttack} etc (attack or raid)

# White Flag - Can delay Attack. Guaranteed win, but the attack is only delayed. Requires pacifism or negotiator perk
combatDelay= [FormalName's] pretty good at negotiation. We could send [him] out there to talk to them and delay the attack.
combatDelay_option= Send [Name] to negotiate
combatDelay_outcome_success= [Name] convinced the {1} to hold off on their {2} for two days. But they aren't budging unless they hear word of a ceasefire between our factions.
combatDelay_outcome_fail= Whaaa? combatDelay_outcome_fail?


# Look Over Here! - Can send someone out to distract attackers to improve chances. If fails, person gets injured along with normal loss penalty. Requires stinky perk.
combatStinky= Gah - is that horrible smell coming from [FormalName]? We could send [him] out there to distract the zed.
combatStinky_option= Send smelly [Name] to distract
combatStinky_outcome_success= For once [Name's] nauseating body odor came in useful. The zombies were so confused by the pungent mix of sweaty feet, dried urine, and patchouli oil that they didn't recognize [him] as a tasty human. [He] could walk right up and decapitate them while they stood sniffing the air.
combatStinky_outcome_fail= At first, the zombies weren't sure if the pungent [Name] was one of us or one of them. They paused and sniffed the air for a few seconds, then one of them let out a howl and they rushed [him].


# Bullet Storm - Can spend 2x ammo for a bigger bonus. Requires equipped gun and firearms or superdude perk.
combatAmmoDouble= [FormalName] is an excellent marksman, but [he]'s almost out of ammo. We could make sure [he]'s stocked up.
combatAmmoDouble_option= Give [Name] extra ammo
combatAmmoDouble_outcome_success= We're thinking of nicknaming [Name] '[*headshot|knee-capper|hollowpoint]' after [his] performance today. Good thing we've got plenty of bullets for [him].
combatAmmoDouble_outcome_fail= There were just too many of them. Even with a great shot like [Name] you can only focus on one head at a time.


# Hard Hit - Can break weapon to gain bonus. Requires melee weapon equipped but no perk.
# {3} = weapon type broken
combatBreakMelee= [FormalName] is raring to go but [his] {3} looks like it's going to break. We could sacrifice it to try to turn the tide.
combatBreakMelee_option= Sacrifice [Name's] {3}
combatBreakMelee_outcome_success= [Name] eventually broke [his] {3} over the head of the last attacker, but [he] took out plenty of others before that happened.
combatBreakMelee_outcome_fail= The {3} shattered ineffectively when [Name] swung at the first attacker, and things just went downhill from there.



# Over Do It! - Lowered danger but guaranteed injury. Bunch of perks including hand to hand, rebellious, addict
combatFrenzy= [FormalName] is so pumped [he]'s practically foaming at the mouth. [He]'ll do serious damage to both [himself] and the {1} if we let [him] loose on them.
combatFrenzy_option= Let [Name] loose on them
combatFrenzy_outcome_success= [Name] went completely nuts on the {1} and singlehandedly won us the fight. Then [he] collapsed in pain. I didn't realize you could put out your back by screaming too loud but I guess the human body has it's limits. [He]'ll be out for a few days.
combatFrenzy_outcome_fail= We backed out of [his] way and let [Name] unleash a frenzy on the {1}, but it wasn't enough.


# Give Them the Good Stuff - Can spend 2X food for major bonus.
#combatGiveThemGoodStuff = [Name] could distract the zed using [his] culinary arts. It'll take a bit of food though.
#combatGiveThemGoodStuff_option = Let [Name] cook up a storm
#combatGiveThemGoodStuff_outcome_success = [Name] made what looked like a human carcase entirely out of tofu. It was so good even the zed were fooled.
#combatGiveThemGoodStuff_outcome_fail = [Name] prepared a 3-course feast for the zed and they shambled right past it. Some undead wouldn't know a good meal even if their tongues hadn't already fallen out.


# Will You Join Our Barricade? - Can spend 2X building materials for major bonus.
combatBarricadeDouble= Our construction expert [FormalName] thinks [he] could slap together a makeshift catapult using some building materials.
combatBarricadeDouble_option= Have [Name] build a catapult
combatBarricadeDouble_outcome_success= It was more like a teeter-totter. You drop a crate of bricks on one end, and whatever's sitting on the other end gets flung at the {1}. Very effective. We're taking bets on who's going to be the first to ride it.
combatBarricadeDouble_outcome_fail= [Name's] catapult was a good idea, [he] just didn't have enough time to make it work. The {1} advanced on us too quickly, so we were forced to abandon it and go for the traditional defense methods of running and screaming.


# Field Medic - Can spend 2X medicine. Bonus and nobody can die.
combatMedicineDouble= We could keep our medic [FormalName] well stocked with medical supplies so he can keep everyone alive.
combatMedicineDouble_option= Give [Name] medical supplies
combatMedicineDouble_outcome_success= [Name] was all over the battlefield, applying gauze here or checking a pulse there. I'm not sure how much [he] really helped, but it sure made us feel better to see [him] out there.
combatMedicineDouble_outcome_fail= Thanks to [Name] and [his] medicine, at least no one died. That's really the best you can say in a situation like this.


# Do it by Myself - Survivor will take the brunt of attack. Same danger but survivor takes any injury/death.
combatAlone= [FormalName] has a plan to lead the attackers away by [himself]. It'll be dangerous for [him], but everyone else should be OK.
combatAlone_option= Let [Name] lead them away
combatAlone_outcome_success= [Name] let the {1} chase [him] around the neighborhood for an hour while we picked them off one by one. Man can that [boy] run!
combatAlone_outcome_fail= I wish we could all be that brave and/or foolish at least once in our lives. It must have taken incredible courage (and/or stupidity) for [Name] to put [himself] at risk like that. Unfortunately...


# Coordinated Defense - Bonus if 3 or more defenders. On fail get an additional injury (Name). No perk needed
combatCoordinate= There are a lot of us. If we coordinate in one place we'll have an advantage, but may face more casualties if we lose.
combatCoordinate_option= Coordinate our defenses
combatCoordinate_outcome_success= We got everyone working together like a well-oiled machine and steamrolled over the {1} and everything else in our path. Live together, die alone.
combatCoordinate_outcome_fail= We were tripping over each other the whole time. Twice [Name] nearly took out one of our own guys, then on top of it all got injured [himself].


# Run Away! - Guaranteed loss, but guaranteed no injuries. More extreme version of "Get Out of There!"
#combatRunAway = [Name] thinks we should just get out of there. No one should get hurt, but there's no way we'll win like that.
#combatRunAway_option = Run for it!
#combatRunAway_outcome_success = How the hell did that happen? There's no way we should have come out of that smelling of roses.
#combatRunAway_outcome_fail = We let the {1} have the [square]. It was more important that we keep our people safe. {3}


# Wild Plan - Survivor comes up with an insane plan that just might work. 50% chance to make things a lot better. 50% chance to make things a lot worse.
#combatWildPlan = That eccentric [Name] has a plan involving [*cotton candy and a dozen rubber ducks|30 pounds of manure and a backhoe|an old BMW and 40 slinkies]. It could work... or it may make things worse.
#combatWildPlan_option = Use [Name's] wild plan
#combatWildPlan_outcome_success = We're still alive, but I think I'm mentally scarred for life. Can we not put [Name] in charge again? I would like that very much.
#combatWildPlan_outcome_fail = Well, that failed spectacularly. I'm not saying it wasn't fun to watch, but it didn't end up helping in the slightest. {3}


# Friend in Need - Can call for help from friendly faction. Big bonus, lose the friendship perk on failure.
# {3} = faction short name
combatFactionHelpPerk= Some old friends from {3} are here visiting [FormalName]. They could help us out as a favor to [him].
combatFactionHelpPerk_option= Have [Name] ask {3} for help
combatFactionHelpPerk_outcome_success= Just when it looked like all was lost, {3} joined in like the goddamn cavalry and we kicked the {1} off our land. Maybe [Name's] right about those guys.
combatFactionHelpPerk_outcome_fail= There were just too many {1} for us to handle and one of {3} was badly hurt. [Name] got into a big fight with [his] friends afterwards and I don't think they'll be coming to visit again.


# Price of Friendship - Can call for help from Gustav. Guaranteed big bonus as help, but costs 1/2 Z food. {3} = payment on success
#combatPriceOfFriendship = [Name] could probably get a good deal from Gustav if we wanted to hire some mercenaries.
#combatPriceOfFriendship_option = Send [Name] to Gustav
#combatPriceOfFriendship_outcome_success = I don't like Gustav's merc's much, but I can't deny efficiency. Within minutes of them showing up the {1} we either dead or scattered to the four winds. {3}
#combatPriceOfFriendship_outcome_fail = Gustav's men were too little, too late. And, on top of the loss, we still need to pay him. {3}



######################################
# LOCATION COMBAT EVENTS
######################################

# square = square that is giving the bonus.

# Medicine on Hand - Spend 1/2 X medicine for regular "Bandages for Everyone!" bonus.
#combatMedicineOnHand = [Name] is holding out in the [square]. If we give [him] some extra meds [he] should stay alive no matter what happens.
#combatMedicineOnHand_option = Have [Name] stay safe
#combatMedicineOnHand_outcome_success = [Name] hunkered down in our [square] and beat back anyone foolish enough to get between [him] and [his] pills.
#combatMedicineOnHand_outcome_fail = Well, between the supplies we gave [him] and what [he] scrounged from the shelves of the [square], [Name] is still in the land of the living. Losing the fight still hurts though. {3}


# Toxic Fumes - There are volatile chemicals nearby. On fail, building is rubble.
combatToxicFumes= The [square] has a bunch of volatile fumes we could set off. It'll be dangerous for whoever lights the fuse though.
combatToxicFumes_option= Light the fumes
combatToxicFumes_outcome_success= The chemical explosion took out most of the {1} and nearly caught [Name] at the same time. It'll take a while for [his] [*fingernails|hair|eyebrows] to grow back.
combatToxicFumes_outcome_fail= There's not much left of the {1}. Or the building for that matter.


# Not the Booze! - Can use the beer/rum/sacramental wine as a weapon. Danger down, morale penalty on win or lose.
combatBurnBooze= There are old bottles of wine in the [square] we could weaponize, but setting fire to our booze will upset people.
combatBurnBooze_option= Set fire to the booze
combatBurnBooze_outcome_success= Our molotov cocktails left the enemy blackened husks of their former selves, and the fumes left our defenders feeling a little tipsy. It was a sad thing seeing all that alcohol go up in flames though.
combatBurnBooze_outcome_fail= Great. The {1} kicked our butts, and now we don't even have anything left to drown our sorrows in.


# Death From Above - Throw scavengeables down onto attackers.
combatScavengedResources= We haven't finished scavenging the [square] yet and there's a bunch of stuff here. We could toss it off the roof at them.
combatScavengedResources_option= Throw stuff off the roof
combatScavengedResources_outcome_success= Today's forecast: falling bricks, various toxic liquids, and the occasional power tool. Oops, looks like the {1} didn't bring their umbrellas...
combatScavengedResources_outcome_fail= The {1} dodged our random stuff pretty easily, which is too bad because we could have used some of it.


# Lighting the Reserves - Use the available fuel to set attackers on fire. Spend 1/2 X fuel for regular "Light 'em Up!" bonus.
#combatLightingTheReserves = We could probably siphon some fuel from the nearby [square] and set fire to that.
#combatLightingTheReserves_option = siphon and ignite fuel
#combatLightingTheReserves_outcome_success = We were able to scrounge up enough fuel to get a good fire burning between us and the {1}. I just wish I hadn't been the one doing the siphoning. I'm going to be tasting gas for the next week.
#combatLightingTheReserves_outcome_fail = We ran from gas tank to gas tank, but each one was dry as a bone. Meanwhile the {1} tore our through our defenders without mercy. {3}


# Rotten Meat - If there is scavengable food on the square, can throw it to the zombies for reduced danger
combatScavengedFood= Looks like there's still food in this [square] we haven't scavenged yet. Maybe the zed would rather chew on it than us.
combatScavengedFood_option= Throw food to the zombies
combatScavengedFood_outcome_success= I'm not sure why but they went nuts fighting over the beef jerky and gum, stringing the Bubble Tape out between them like intestines. The chewing motion seemed to soothe them, then their jaws got all stuck together.
combatScavengedFood_outcome_fail= Nope. These zed seem to prefer something that they hunt themselves. The food went completely ignored.


# Buckshot - Scrounge ammo from the environment. Spend 1/2 X Ammo for regular "Lock and Load" bonus.
#combatBuckshot = We might be able to find some ammo we missed in the nearby [square]. Right now every bullet counts.
#combatBuckshot_option = Gather extra ammo
#combatBuckshot_outcome_success = With enough gunpowder anything will become a bullet. Nails, teeth, whatever. I'm not looking forward to servicing our guns though.
#combatBuckshot_outcome_fail = I guess we hadn't picked up that ammo for a reason. None of our bullets found their mark, if they even went off at all. {3}


# Free Running - Loads of space to move/duck/hide. Bonus to defenders without weapons, penalty to those with.
#combatFreeRunning = We could use the open space in the [square]. It'll be easier for those not lugging weapons to get around.
#combatFreeRunning_option = Take advantage of the open area
#combatFreeRunning_outcome_success = It don't matter if you're outnumbered if they can't catch you. Our guys ran circles around the {1}.
#combatFreeRunning_outcome_fail = The problem with plenty of open space is there's nothing to stop your opponent from running too. Our guys were so tired when the {1} caught up with them, they didn't put up much of a fight. {3}


# Tight Quarters - Bonus to defenders with Melee, penalty to using firearms.
#combatTightQuarters = We could use the [square]'s tight quarters. It'll be good for our brawlers, but hard for our snipers.
#combatTightQuarters_option = Take advantage of the tight quarters
#combatTightQuarters_outcome_success = With the tight spaces of the [square] the {1} could only come at us a couple at a time, and our brawlers made quick work of them.
#combatTightQuarters_outcome_fail = The {1] pushed through our [square] like toothpaste being squeezed out of tube. And our defenders were the tiny bits of plaque that were quickly scrubbed out. {3}


# Chest High Walls - Use cover. Defenders receive bonus for defenders with guns, penalty for defenders with melee weapons.
#combatChestHighWalls = There's plenty of cover in the [square]. It'll be great for our snipers, but hard for brawlers to get around.
#combatChestHighWalls_option = Take advantage of the chest high walls
#combatChestHighWalls_outcome_success = It was really nice having plenty of cover on hand. Too bad we don't have that every time a fight starts, but I'll take what I can get.
#combatChestHighWalls_outcome_fail = I think we spent a little too long ducking behind our cover. When we looked up the {1} were right on top of us. {3}

# TECH COMBAT EVENTS
######################################

# Aim for the Head - Order headshots only. Will usually improve chances, but a series of bad misses can make things turn sour fast. (25% chance to backfire).
#combatAimForTheHead = Thanks to our vitals research we know exactly where to hit these zed.
#combatAimForTheHead_option = Mandate headshots only
#combatAimForTheHead_outcome_success = The battlefield was a sea of exploding skulls. I kind of feel I should gotten an achievement for that.
#combatAimForTheHead_outcome_fail = I think our people need more target practice. The few shots we got in were great, but we didn't get nearly enough. {3}


# Camouflage - Disguise defenders as zombies. Bonus, but chance of friendly fire (chance of backfire increases with number of defenders - 1 = 0, 2 = 10%, 3 = 20%, etc) {3} = injury on success if it happens
#combatCamouflage = We could disguise our guys as zed. Friendly fire will be a problem if we've got a lot of people in the fight though.
#combatCamouflage_option = Disguise as zombies
#combatCamouflage_outcome_success = It was disgusting painting ourselves with rotten meat, but pay off of seeing the zed wander around looking confused was worth it. {3}
#combatCamouflage_outcome_fail = Great, now I smell like I spent the night in a slaughterhouse and we still lost the fight. {3}


# On the Job Training - Slightly reduced chance to win, but survivors learn much more about combat.
combatTraining= Our research suggests we should try some on the job training. It'd be more dangerous, but we'll learn something.
combatTraining_option= Do on the job training
combatTraining_outcome_success= We pulled our punches and studied how the {1} fight. We learned quite a bit about defense today. Class dismissed!
combatTraining_outcome_fail= Well at least we can say we learned something from this fight, though maybe this wasn't a good time for a defense lesson after all.


# Poison - Coat weapons with zombie saliva. Bonus, but chance of survivor getting infected. {3} = on success if someone gets infected
#combatPoison = We could use zombie saliva as a poison. We need to be careful that none of our people get infected though.
#combatPoison_option = Use poison
#combatPoison_outcome_success = That zombie saliva dropped the {1} plenty quick. Now we just need to make sure that we clean up the bodies before they turn. {3}
#combatPoison_outcome_fail = That zombie poison works quick. Too quick. Soon we were fighting the [FactionNoThe] and their fallen comrades at the same time. It was all too much. {3}


# Nobody's Home - Hide and pretend no one is there. Can delay attack, but defender's ratings reduced if attack happens.
#combatNoOneHome = We could just pretend no one is here. The zed might just get bored and leave.
#combatNoOneHome_option = Hide
#combatNoOneHome_outcome_success = We didn't kill any of them, but they didn't kill any of us. I'd say that works out.
#combatNoOneHome_outcome_fail = It doesn't matter how well we hid, the zed still smelt our fear. {3}


# Nerve Gas - Whip up some basic nerve gas. Guaranteed to kill attackers, but can also kill one of the defenders. {3} = on success if someone dies
#combatNerveGas = We could make nerve gas using easy-to-find household chemicals. It'll be dangerous for whoever's handling it though.
#combatNerveGas_option = Make nerve gas
#combatNerveGas_outcome_success = The gas was invisible, odorless and dropped the {1} before they knew what was happening. {3}
#combatNerveGas_outcome_fail = The problem with toxic warfare is it's toxic to everybody. Us included. {3}

# EQUIPMENT COMBAT EVENTS
######################################

# Release the Hound - Send dog in to increase defenses, but dog will die on lose.
# {3} = dog's name
combatDog= [FormalName] could send out [his] dog {3} to join the fight, though it'll be dangerous for the dog.
combatDog_option= Send {3} to join the fight
combatDog_outcome_success= {3} was a true champion, and by the end there wasn't an enemy ankle, shin or crotch without the dog's teeth marks in it.
combatDog_outcome_fail= {3} was struck down during the fight and didn't get up again. Even with {3}'s valiant efforts, the {1} were too much.


# Monster Trucks - Do something with an equipped car/truck/etc, destroying if you fail.
# {3} = car
combatCar= We could drive our {3} into them.
combatCar_option= Drive {3} into attackers
combatCar_outcome_success= We plowed into the {1}, crippling their main force. We're going to be picking bits of brain out of the tires for the next week.
combatCar_outcome_fail= There were too many of them. We eventually ran out of gas and had to abandon the {3} and run for it.
# this event always follows combatCar. Gassing increases effect, and prevents car from being destroyed
#combatCar2 = I'm not sure if it'll survive, but we'll do more damage if the thing is properly fueled.
#combatCar2_option = Gas up {3} and drive through attackers
#combatCar2_outcome_success = We tore through the {1}, leaving a trail of broken and battered corpses in our wake.
#combatCar2_outcome_fail = You can only run over so many skulls before something gets stuck. At least the {3} is fine.

# RocketsRocketsRockets - Fire rockets like mad! 4x the ammo cost? May break rocket launcher?
combatRocketLauncher= We can let loose with [Name's] rocket launcher. It's gonna take a whole bunch of ammo though.
combatRocketLauncher_option= Let loose with the rocket launcher
combatRocketLauncher_outcome_success= Rockets! Rockets! Rockets! Everywhere! By the time we were done there wasn't anything left of {1} but a bunch of smoking craters
combatRocketLauncher_outcome_fail= I think we have may have gotten a little over enthusiastic. We ended up blowing away our own defenses, along with everything else.


# I Am Not Left Handed - Can challenge the attacking faction to a duel. Requires equipped melee weapon. On fail, duelist is killed. Against faction only.
#{3} = weapon used by duelist
combatDuel= [Name] could challenge their leader to a duel to the death. It'll be a rough fight but it'll keep the rest of us safe.
combatDuel_option= Challenge them to a duel
combatDuel_outcome_success= The duel was short, bloody and final. [Name] walked away the victor and [faction] left with their tails between their legs.
combatDuel_outcome_fail= They claimed [Name's] severed head as part of their prize. I guess we'll have to make do with burying the rest of [him].


# Steal their weapon - Can try to steal a weapon from the enemy, but increases danger. Only factions.
# {3} stolen weapon in outcome
combatStealWeapon= We could use the confusion to steal one of their weapons. It's risky, but the reward could be worth it.
combatStealWeapon_option= Steal a weapon
combatStealWeapon_outcome_success= During a lull in the fighting, [Name] stealthily circled around behind the [factionNoThe] and right up to where they were crouched. [He] nabbed a {3} that one of them put down and promptly used it to kill the owner and injure two others. They retreated fast after that.
combatStealWeapon_outcome_fail= We lured [faction] into our fort through an open gate. Then in a spectacular A-Team style maneuver, [Name] lept off a building onto one of them and grabbed [his|her] {3}. But victory was short lived and they were on [him] in seconds. We did manage to keep the {3}, but the fight didn't end well.

# Tower / Bunker / Turret - Building must have a defensive upgrade. Focus your defense on the tower, bunker or turret upgrade on this building (use {3} to differentiate). Decreases danger, but upgrade is destroyed on fail.
# {3} bunker, turret, tower
combatFortifications= We could focus our defense on the {3} we built nearby and have that take the brunt of the attack.
combatFortifications_option= Focus defense on the {3}
combatFortifications_outcome_success= If was a tough fight and we were glad for the extra cover. Our {3} is pretty torn up and needs a new coat of paint, but it's still standing, and so are we.
combatFortifications_outcome_fail= The {1} stormed us at the {3} just as we planned, but the added cover wasn't enough. After the {3} fell, we had to retreat.

# PHASE 2 COMBAT EVENTS
######################################

# Preparations start - Do something that has no effect in this battle, but makes another option available in later battles (until you use it) with a huge bonus.
# combatPrepStart = We could tell our people to hold back. This battle won't be easy, but we'll be fresh for the next fight.
# combatPrepStart_option = Prepare for the next fight
# combatPrepStart_outcome_success = Even with us [*studying their attack-strategies|setting up fortifications mid-fight|taking it easy] {1} couldn't match us. And now we're extra ready for the next time we fight.
# combatPrepStart_outcome_fail = When you spend too much time looking ahead and not dealing with the here-and-now, you're bound to pay the price.


# Preparations done - Because you prepared earlier, now you can unleash some devastating thing during a later battle, even if it's somewhere else with different defenders and different foes. Because I don't want to track that stuff.
# combatPrepEnd = We can take advantage of all our prep work from the previous fight. The {1} will never know what hit them.
# combatPrepEnd_option = Take advantage of our preparations
# combatPrepEnd_outcome_success = That goes to show what a little planning and forethought will get you. Those bastards never saw us coming.
# combatPrepEnd_outcome_fail = Even with all our prep-work we still couldn't fight them off. Where did they all come from?
